The A Team by Ed Sheeran

[Verse 1]
White lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus]
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

[Verse 2]
Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus]
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

[Bridge]
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hopin' for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Alternate Chorus]
And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
For angels to die

What a promise you make now could mean when the day comes, that everything you see
Is without me

Give Me Love by Ed Sheeran

[Verse 1]
Give me love like her
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt
Told you I'd let them go

[Refrain 1]
And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight I'll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Give a little time to me, or burn this out
We ll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow

[Chorus]
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, give me love

[Verse 2]
Give me love like never before
'Cause lately I've been craving more
And it's been a while, but I still feel the same
Maybe I should let you go

[Refrain 2]
You know I'll fight my corner
And that tonight I'll call ya
After my blood is drowning in alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Give a little time to me, or burn this out
We ll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Give a little time to me, or burn this out
We ll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow

Immortal by J. Cole

[Intro]
Awwwww...haha

[Verse 1]
Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin' "dollar and a dream" with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BowFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a Carl Thom vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt

[Hook]
Real niggas don't die
Forward with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five
Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't lie
Form in the plot
My niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

[Verse 2]
Have you ever seen a fiend cook crack on the spoon?
Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?
Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cry?
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
Kingpin nigga, put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team
And I'm goin' out like Scarface in his last scene
A legend, what that mean ?

[Hook]
Real niggas don't die
Forward with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five
Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Hood niggas don't lie
Form in the plot
My niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

[Outro]
To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
'Cause you wanna change the world, but while alive you never will
'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch, "Make it quick if the Lord take me"
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas, "sell dope, rap or go to NBA"
In that order, it's that sort of thinkin'
That been keepin' niggas chained at the bottom and hanged
The strangest fruit that you ever seen, ripe with pain, listen...

Cool Girl by Tove Lo

[Verse 1]
You can run free, I won't hold it against ya
You do your thing, never wanted a future
Fuck if I knew how to put it romantic
Speaking my truth, there's no need to panic

[Pre-Chorus]
No, let's not put a label on it
Let's keep it fun
We don't put a label on it
So we can run free, yeah
I wanna be free like you

[Chorus]
I'm a, I'm a
I'm a cool girl, I'm a, I'm a cool girl
Ice cold, I roll my eyes at you, boy
I'm a cool girl, I'm a, I'm a cool girl
Ice cold, I roll my eyes at you, boy

[Verse 2]
Rules you don't like, but you still wanna keep 'em
Said you were fine so for whatever reason
Sure we can chill, try and keep it platonic
Now you can't tell if I'm really ironic

[Pre-Chorus]
No, let's not put a label on it
Let's keep it fun
We don't put a label on it
So we can run free, yeah
I wanna be free like you

[Chorus]
I'm a, I'm a
I'm a cool girl, I'm a, I'm a cool girl
Ice cold, I roll my eyes at you, boy
I'm a cool girl, I'm a, I'm a cool girl
Ice cold, I roll my eyes at you, boy
I'm a cool girl, I'm a, I'm a cool girl
Ice cold, I roll my eyes at you, boy
I'm a cool girl, I'm a, I'm a cool girl
Ice cold, I roll my eyes at you, boy

[Bridge]
I got fever highs
I got boiling blood
I'm that fire kind
We could burn together

[Chorus]
I'm a
I'm a cool girl, I'm a, I'm a cool girl
Ice cold, I roll my eyes at you, boy
I'm a cool girl, I'm a, I'm a cool girl
Ice cold, I roll my eyes at you, boy

[Outro]
I'm a cool girl, I'm a, I'm a cool girl
Too cool for you
I'm a cool girl, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a
I'm a, I'm a cool girl, I'm a, I'm a cool girl
Ice cold, I roll my eyes at you, boy

Wake Up Where You Are by State of Sound

[Verse 1]
Never thought that I would love again
Never thought I'd see the end of grain
Now I know I gotta get away
I need to kill the pain
Wanna see what's on the other side
Gotta know that there is more to life
Come along and open up my eyes
I wanna see the fire

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm calling for you desperately
To save me and be my remedy
And take me to a better place
And come with me

[Chorus]
We are young, on the run
Let the love free your mind
We can be who we are
Like we never will die
When the sun's coming up
We'll be higher than stars
And I wanna wake up where you are

[Verse 2]
Hold me close and never let me go
Wanna dance until the high runs out
We're not ready for the afterglow
So hit me one more time
If tomorrow ever gets me down
Gotta keep on being on the run
'Cause I wanna live without a line
Between the moon and sun

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Release me, kill my misery
And redirect my destiny
We're heading for a better day
So far away

[Chorus]
We are young, on the run
Let the love free your mind
We can be who we are
Like we never will die
When the sun's coming up
We'll be higher than stars
And I wanna wake up where you are

And I wanna wake up where you are

[Break]

[Chorus]
We are young, on the run
Let the love free your mind
We can be who we are
Like we never will die
When the sun's coming up
We'll be higher than stars
And I wanna wake up where you are

And I wanna wake up where you are

You & Me by Marc E. Bassy

[Verse 1: Marc E. Bassy]
Girl you party all the time
Don't let me stay on your mind
Adderall and cheap wine
Just to stay awake in conversation
We were always so damn insecure
So how could we ever know for sure
And disregard the way I know we feel
That would make this city way too real

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It s not us no more
It s just you and me
We re just strangers in passing casually
It s not us no more
It s just you and me

[Verse 2: Marc E. Bassy]
The shirt on my back with the rips
Gems in my golden necklace
You didn't give me none of this
There's nothing for me to miss
We were too young on the day we met
How could we say we would not forget
And in the shadows there's a place for us
Somewhere hidden they can't find our love
Don't let 'em know

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It s not us no more
It s just you and me
We re just strangers in passing casually
It s not us no more
It s just you and me

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Eazy, and these days it's just you and me
This shit is dead and gone, it's not what it used to be
Someone give a eulogy
Know I'm hard headed and I might of acted foolishly
But you the one to hold us down usually
We was in a limbo
But of all people you ain't have to fuck with him though
That was my homie I had gave y'all the intro
Some things fall apart and some get thrown out the window
Remember when we first met we might've been too young
But we was from The Bay so we both was going too dumb
I used to be the one for you now you got a new one
So till the next lifetime, maybe we can do some'n
Eazy

[Hook: Marc E. Bassy]
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It s not us no more
It s just you and me
We re just strangers in passing casually
It s not us no more It s just you and me

[Outro: Marc E. Bassy]
If we bump into each other
On a crowded street
It's not us no more

Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm

[Verse 1]
Nobody ever knows
Nobody ever sees
I left my soul
Back then, no I'm too weak

[Pre-Chorus]
Most nights I pray for you to come home
Praying to the lord
Praying for my soul

[Chorus]
Now please don't go
Most nights I hardly sleep when I'm alone
Now please don't go, oh no
I think of you whenever I'm alone
So please don't go

[Verse 2]
Cause I don't ever wanna know
Don't ever want to see things change
Cause when I'm living on my own
I wanna take it back and start again

[Pre-Chorus]
Most nights I pray for you to come home
I'm praying to the lord
I'm praying for my soul

[Chorus]
Now please don't go
Most nights I hardly sleep
When I'm alone
Now please don't go, oh no
I think of you whenever I'm alone
So please don't go

[Bridge]
I sent so many messages
You don't reply
Gotta figure out, what am I missing babe?
Singing now, oh oh oh
I need you now, I need your love, oh

[Chorus]
Now please don't go
I said most nights I hardly sleep
When I'm alone
Now please don't go, oh no
I think of you whenever I'm alone
So please don't, (please) don't go
So please (please) don't go
(Please) don't go, oh no
So please don't go
I think of you whenever I'm alone
So please don't go

Say It (feat. Tove Lo) by Flume

[Verse 1: Tove Lo]
Feelin' the song, party done, shadows walkin' home
Walkin' with our game on
You are my kind, classic mind, and you look so fine
Mmm, mmm-mmm mmm
Lovin' the cold, smoke a roll, see your fingers shake
I'm gettin' through your heart break
Some kinda freak, sing for me, don't know what I need
Mmm, mmm-mmm, mmm

[Pre-Chorus: Tove Lo]
Don't doubt me, babe
You make me wanna change
Break my bed to make me wanna stay

You make me love the pain
Break my bed to make me wanna stay
I can't...

I'm gettin' the door, silent walk, who's the first to speak?
Speak it like a real freak
Voice in my head, in my bed, filled with you instead
Mmm, mmm-mmm mmm
Takin' your time, work my mind, and I play with you
I play pretend it's so true
Follow me down, listen 'round to the deep dark sound
Mmm, mmm-mmm mmm

Don't doubt me, babe

Hymn for the Weekend by Coldplay

[Intro: Beyoncé]
And said drink from me, drink from me
(Oh-ah-oh-ah)
That we shoot across the sky
Symphony
That we shoot across the sky
Pour on a...
Drink from me, drink from me
(Oh-ah-oh-ah)
That we shoot across the sky
Symphony
(So high, so high)
That we shoot across the sky

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin with Beyoncé]
You said drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
Poured on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Oh-I-Oh-I-Oh-I
Now I m feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
(Woo)
(Woo-ooo-ooo-woo)

[Verse 2: Chris Martin with Beyoncé]

Say Something Loving by The xx

[Intro: Alessi Brothers]
Before it slips away

[Chorus 1: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
Say something loving
I just don't remember the thrill of affection
I just don't remember
Say something loving
I need a reminder, the feeling's escaped me

[Verse 1: Romy Madley Croft]
I went looking for it
Could have been anyone's kiss
Throwing my arms at no one
When I gave up, I found love

[Verse 2: Oliver Sim]
The thought flows through my mind
And it's growing all the time
I do myself a disservice
To feel this weak, to be this nervous

[Chorus 2: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
You say something loving
It's so overwhelming, the thrill of affection
Feels so unfamiliar
You say something loving
Without hesitation it hits me, hits me
It feels so unfamiliar

[Post-Chorus: Alessi Brothers]
Before it slips away

[Verse 3: Romy Madley Croft]
Your touch stays on my skin
I feel it start sinking in
Here come my insecurities
I almost expect you to leave

[Verse 4: Oliver Sim]
Were you really looking for me?
Try your best to reassure me
I wasn't patient to meet you
Am I too needy, am I too eager?

[Interlude: Romy Madley Croft & Oliver Sim]
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what this is, but it doesn't feel wrong
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what this is, but it doesn't feel wrong

[Pre-Chorus: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
Did you hear me say it?
Say it
Did you hear me say?

[Chorus 3: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
I say something loving
I can't hold it inside, the thrill of affection
Is only getting stronger
I say something loving
All my hesitations are fading, fading
I feel it taking over

[Outro: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft & Alessi Brothers]
Before it slips away
Don't let it slip away
Before it slips away
Don't let it slip away

Dangerous by The xx

[Verse 1: Oliver Sim]
They say we're in danger
But I disagree
If proven wrong, shame on me
But you've had faith in me
So I won't shy away
Should it all fall down
You'll have been my favourite mistake

[Chorus: Romy  Madley Croft Oliver Sim]
They say
You are dangerous, but I don't care
I'm going to pretend that I'm not scared
If this only ends in tears
Then I won't say goodbye
'Cause I couldn't care less
If they call us reckless
Until they are breathless
They must be blind

[Verse 2: Romy Madley Croft]
There are voices ringing over
They keep saying, "Danger, danger"
I can't make them take you under
Makes no difference
No one can take this away
Should it all fall down, I'll treasure each day

[Chorus: Romy Madley Croft Oliver Sim]
They say
You are dangerous, but I don't care
I'm going to pretend that I'm not scared
If this only ends in tears
Then I won't say goodbye
'Cause I couldn't 
'Cause I couldn't care less
If they call us reckless
Until they are breathless
They must be blind

[Bridge: Romy Madley Croft Oliver Sim]
Let them say there are warning signs
They must be blind
They must be blind
They say

[Outro: Oliver Sim]
If this only ends in tears
Then I won't say goodbye

[Chorus]
I ain't no millionaire, but I'm on my way
Can't find love, but hell, I'm on the way
When the world gets heavy, you might hear me say
I'm on my way, on my way, way
On my way, on way, way

[Verse 1]
There's a little devil in us all
Swear everybody in this town just wants to see you fall
Baby, it's no fun, so know it's just a game, yeah
Oh, keep running outta love
And I don't go giving up
When I'm running outta love, love
No, let's say I've had enough
And I don't go giving up
I said it all before

[Chorus]
I ain't no millionaire, but I'm on my way
Can't find love, but hell, I'm on the way
When the world gets heavy, you might hear me say
I'm on my way, on my way, way
I ain't no millionaire, but I'm on my way
Can't find love, but hell, I'm on the way
When the world gets heavy, you might hear me say
I'm on my way, on my way, way
I ain't no millionaire, but I'm on my way
Can't find love, but hell, I'm on the way
When the world gets heavy, you might hear me say
I'm on my way, on my way, way
On my way, on way, way
I ain't no millionaire, but I'm on my way
Can't find love, but hell, I'm on the way
When the world gets heavy, you might hear me say
I'm on my way, on my way, way
I ain't no millionaire, but I'm on my way
Can't find love, but hell, I'm on the way
When the world gets heavy, you might hear me say
I'm on my way, on my way, way

Not Afraid Anymore by Halsey

[Verse 1]
I am not afraid anymore
Standing in the eye of the storm
Ready to face this, dying to taste this, sick sweet warmth
I am not afraid anymore
I want what you got in store
I'm ready to feed now, get in your seat now

[Chorus]
And touch me like you never
And push me like you never
And touch me like you never
'Cause I am not afraid, I am not afraid anymore
No no no

[Post-Chorus]
No no no
No no no
No no no
No no no

[Verse 2]
I am not ashamed anymore
I want something so impure
You better impress now, watching my dress now fall to the floor
Crawling underneath my skin, sweet talk with a hint of sin
Begging you to take me
Devil underneath your grin, sweet thing, but she play to win, heaven gonna hate me

[Chorus]
And touch me like you never
And push me like you never
And touch me like you never
'Cause I am not afraid, I am not afraid anymore
No no no

[Bridge]
Crawling underneath my skin, sweet talk with a hint of sin
Begging you to take me
Devil underneath your grin, sweet thing, but she play to win, heaven gonna hate me

[Chorus]
And touch me like you never
And push me like you never
And touch me like you never
'Cause I am not afraid, I am not afraid anymore
No no no

Somebody Else by VÉRITÉ

[Verse 1]
So I heard you found somebody else
And at first I thought it was a lie
So I took all my things that make sounds
And the rest I can do without

[Chorus]
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
A love gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else
I'm looking through you while you're looking through your phone
And leaving with somebody else
No I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else

[Verse 2]
Come on, baby
This ain't the last time that I'll see your face
Come on, baby
You said you'd find someone to take my place
Oh I don't believe that you have got it in you
Cause we are just gonna keep doin' it and every time
I start to believe in anything you're sayin'
I'm reminded that I should be gettin' over it

[Chorus]
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
A love gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else
I'm looking through you while you're looking through your phone
And leaving with somebody else
No I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Somebody else
Somebody else
Somebody else

[Bridge]
Get someone you love
Get someone you need
Fuck that, get money
Cause I can't give you my soul cause we're never alone
Get someone you love
Get someone you need
Fuck that, get money
Cause I can't give you my soul cause we're never alone
Get someone you love
Get someone you need
Fuck that, get money
Cause I can't give you my soul cause we're never alone
Get someone you love
Get someone you need
Fuck that, get money
Cause I can't give you my soul and

[Chorus]
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
A love gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else
I'm looking through you while you're looking through your phone
And leaving with somebody else
No I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else

[Outro]
No I don't want your body
I don't want your body with somebody else
No I don't want your body
I don't want your body with somebody else

Moving On and Getting Over by John Mayer

[Verse 1]
Moving on and getting over
Are not the same, it seems to me
'Cause you've been gone, I'm growing older
But I still can't seem to get you off my mind
And I do believe I feel you all the time

[Verse 2]
Moving on and getting over
Are not the friends they used to be
It's been so long since I got to hold you
But I still can't seem to get you off my mind
And I do believe I feel you all the time, all the time

[Bridge]
Tell me I can have the fact you've loved me to hold onto
Tell me I can keep the door cracked open, to let light through
For all my running, I can understand
I'm one text away from being back again
But I'm moving on and I'm getting over
I'm getting over, I'm getting over
I got to get over

[Verse 3]
Moving on and getting over
It's been so long; it just goes to show you
That I still can't seem to get you off my mind (get you off my mind)
And I sure would like to see you one more time

[Outro]
It's taken me so long just to say "so long"
And baby it's so wrong, but I'm moving on
I'm gonna get a new girl
A something-I-can-do-girl
To try to get me through, girl
'Cause I'm moving on
I'm moving on
And I'm moving on
I'm moving on
And I'm moving on
Consider me as good as gone
'Cause I'm moving on
I'm moving on
Moving on, baby
Moving on
Moving on

And I'll be dreamin' of the next time we can go
Into another serotonin overflow

Halfway Off The Balcony by Big Sean

[Intro]
I am ready right now
Uh huh
I look up I don't even know no more
I think it's funny how it go down
I don't even know no more, official shit

[Chorus]
I'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
Overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy
I realized when it comes to girls
That chemistry means way more than anatomy
She mad at me, she been mad at me

[Verse 1]
I'm the livin' proof
That you don't need a master's just to be a masterpiece
People passin' faster than I'm passin' weed
My daddy tell me, "Stay strong, son
And be the man you have to be
Holdin' ship down, don't crash at sea"
Brrrt! Paper on my phone line
It's on my phone like fax for me, that's facts to me
But I don't want it if it can't change shit drastically, dramatically
'Cause actually, I realized time's the most valuable, actually
So I'ma call my favorite girl and she gon' bring that ass for me
And as for me, I'ma text the room number right now
So you ain't gotta hit the front desk and go ask for me
Don't ask for me, don't ask for me
Don't ask for me
Lot of shit been goin' on, things goin' wrong
So don't ask for me

[Chorus]
I'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
Overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy
I realized when it comes to girls
That chemistry means way more than anatomy
She mad at me, she been mad at me

[Verse 2]
She been mad, I've been on the go, on the road
On a roll more than a roller coaster
They can't throw me off track or slow
If I did, I got a long list of hoes on hoes
That quote on quote, say I told you so
Heaven on earth, every night is paradise
I pray I didn't die or overdose, never that
I kept it a hundred, never change, not even for five 20s
Still smokin' at 5:20 like it's 4:20
On a quest for more money, more hungry
Just got my fortune read, she said it's more comin'
Yeah I got the force but never force nothin'
Do it for the love, I'm Forrest Gumpin'
In my city I'm Warren Buffett
I mean business, the shirt is tucked in
The gun's tungsten, fuck it, I'm who not to fuck with
Who the bad bitches gon' fuck with and lames just don't fuck with
My stock's risin', I'm goin' public, if I write it, it's gon' publish
You're fuckin' with the best, no discussion

[Interlude]
So disgusting
It's that 3 and a third shit
Straight up

[Chorus]
I'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
Overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy
I realized when it comes to girls
That chemistry means way more than anatomy
She mad at me, she been mad at me
She been mad

[Outro]
Elder Big Sean: I think you should answer...
Man: Yo, yo your mom callin' you
Big Sean: Um, I'ma call her back
Man: You sure dawg? She keep callin'
Big Sean: Yeah for sure, for sure, bruh, I'ma call her back

Jump Out The Window by Big Sean

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jeremih]
I think I m ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend, though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So yeah, oh yeah, I think I m ready to jump out the window

[Verse 1]
Straight up, straight up, look
Know ya momma didn t raise you to take no disrespect, yeah
I feel, I feel like real queens know how to keep the game in check, yeah
You cried on my phone the whole night
That time he crossed the line yeah, yeah, yeah
(Oh I was there) I went to straighten his ass out
And you told me never mind yeah, yeah, yeah
The question isn't, "Do he love ya?" The question is, "Do ya love yourself?"
You give the best advice to your friends and not take it for yourself
Remember when you used to come through and hit the Mario Kart
And you always picked the princess
I realized you was princess way back then
We the best thing that never happened, but

[Chorus]
I think I'm ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So yeah, oh yeah, I think I'm ready to jump out the window

[Verse 2]
You been up at night, sleep deprivation
What's the hesitation? What's ya reservation?
You been trippin', trippin' with no destination
You need separation, you need recreation
Y'all been arguing every other day
Ya friends gotta step in and break it up like chill, chill, chill
It's no need to turn this into Kill Bill, look
Funny we ran into each other while we leaving
You walked in with a perm
And now yo' hair look like The Weeknd's
I know that you been needin' clarity
Don't mean to sit ya down and turn this into therapy
But you gave too much time to that boy charity, hear me

[Chorus]
I think I'm ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend, though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So yeah, oh yeah, I think I'm ready to jump out the window

[Outro]
Look, I don't mean to sound like the jealous type
But you oughta know (oughta know)
I think me and you should get together sometimes
On the low low low
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth, I gotta know
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth, I gotta know
I don't mean to sound like the jealous type
But you oughta know (oughta know)
I think me and you should get together sometimes
On the low low low
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth, I gotta know
Sometimes I wonder if you even know
How much you worth I gotta know
I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know
I think I'm ready to jump out the window
This one's for you, you, you, you, you, you, you

Owe Me by Big Sean

[Chorus]
All that shit you told me, I believed
The smile on your face the only thing I can't read
Left and now you back inside my life
It's gon' take more than that to set it right though
Cause, you so, fuckin', outta, line
For ever, letting, them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so, fuckin', outta, line

[Verse 1]
Feel like you owe me checks, owe me time, owe me sex
Long nights, no reply, I got no regrets
You disrespect, disrespect, only time I seen you now's on the internet
Just to see if it's somebody else that you tied to
I hit you back when I decide to, you got my tattoo, we was tribal
Then you left and we turned rivals, now you back with the revival
They don't make you feel like I do, they didn't make you perform for me
You was my American Idol how you rocked the mic
Man, we went from long text, now they shorter than a haiku
Seems like all you got is hate for me
All you ever did was take from me
Cause you know you got that walk from me
How you dress and how you talk from me, yeah
Let's not ever disrespect what I meant to ya
It took us being over to see all I did for ya, damn

[Chorus]
All that shit you told me, I believed
The smile on your face the only thing I can't read
Left and now you back inside my life
It's gonna take more than that to set it right though
Cause, you so, fuckin', outta, line
Forever, letting, them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so, fuckin', outta, line

[Verse 2]
I'm just trying to let the past pass
Ain't no future in that, yeah
I stay 100 like my dash, yeah
Have you cummin' faster than The Flash, yeah
Is it all mine, all mine? You know me, I had to ask
Can I hit it like I crash? Sipping pinot by the glass, glass
Honestly, I had to take the time to let my ego go
Realized that that held us back and back's not where we need to go
This don't replace what you did to me
This don't replace what I did to you
Sometimes it ain't about what we did or didn't do
It's about what we getting through
Look, I'm not tryna play the blame game
Point the fingers while we skip the point
Knowing that we both want the same thing
Riding for each other even if we gotta change lanes
If we don't work it out, shame shame
I can't touch these hoes I can't trust, I don't wanna have a fake us

[Chorus]
But all that shit you told me, I believed
The smile on your face the only thing I can't read
Left and now you back inside my life
It's gon' take more than that to set it right though
Cause, you so, fuckin', outta, line
Forever, letting, them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so, fuckin', outta, line

[Outro]
My friends say I should be over you
Getting hurt every time I'm close to you
I think me and you are overdue
I think this is what we supposed to do
Cause, you so, fuckin', outta, line
Forever, letting, them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so, fuckin', outta, line

[Skit: Paparazzi]
Nigga, you know what's about to go down when you walk out that door
Man, I hope these niggas not out here man, fuck
Big Sean, boy, swerve
I don't...with you
Ok, we see you
New girl, new car
Lamborghini Mercy, ok we feel it
Ayy, is this the- is this like the real thing this time with this one?
Or is this another one of those flings?
Like, you gonna bring her home to mom
Does mom know about this one?We know you're close with your mom
What you say about animal cruelty?
Like do you think they should have shot Harambe or like what?
I mean do you think he was going to maul the kid?
We seen you in the furs man, don't lie

Light by Big Sean

[Intro: Big Sean]
Uh-huh, is it time?

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Look, I spent my whole life tryna improvise
I'm not saying that shit for you to sympathize
Spent my whole life tryna find the light that's at the end of the tunnel
I should have realized it was inside
So lately I been trying to get what's inside outside
So many people wanna see my insides outside
I'm from that city four hours east of Southside
Where everyone outside, but don't fuck with no outsiders
Going up, with the ones I hold it down with
Whole city got my back on some photobomb shit
Whole city blowing up on some old Saddam shit
Before this, I was the one hoes tried to go to prom with

[Refrain: Big Sean]
You know, take the fame, take the crib, take our cars
Now we gotta take the train, hood niggas takin' chains
Slavemaster take our names, 5-0 take the shot
And young souls take the blame, man but they can't take away
The light

[Chorus: Jeremih & Big Sean]
No matter how much they gon' shade you
No, man they can't fuck with the light
They can't stop the shine
They can't fuck with the light
Hell nah, the boy's that bright
Even if you take away my life, you can't take the light
No matter how much they gon' shade you

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Got the whole city on fire
Boy, this the flow that got Steph Curry inspired
This the flow that got Lebron James finna rewire
This the flow that got my whole family finna retire
Flows on flows, I might drown in this bitch
Ye found a pro, I guess I'm profound in this bitch
My dad from Louisiana, man the smallest town
Where if they know you're brown, they might hold you down and even hose you down, man
Since I'm his son, I feel like I gotta stunt hard
I took the hand that they gave me and played the Donald Trump card
And realized counting money never feel as good as counting blessings
And a loaded mind is more dangerous than a loaded weapon

[Refrain: Big Sean]
So when they take the fame, take the crib, take our cars
Now we gotta take the train, and hood niggas takin' chains
Slavemaster take our names, 5-0 take the shot
And young souls take the blame, man but they can't take away
The light

[Chorus: Jeremih & Big Sean]
No matter how much they gon' shade you
No, man they can't fuck with the light
They can't stop the shine
No, man they can't fuck with the light
Hell nah, the boy's that bright
Even if you take away my life, you can't take the light
No matter how much they gon' shade you

[Outro: Jeremih]
Don't let them take away your soul
No, no (No, no)
Don't let them take away what makes you whole

Voices In My Head/Stick To The Plan by Big Sean

Part 1: "Voices in My Head"

[Chorus]
Voices in my head sayin' I could do better, damn
Voices in my head sayin' that I knew better
(You know better, what the fuck!)
I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular
But I still crossed the line like I'm blind, damn
Voices in my head saying I could do better
(You always do the same shit)

[Verse]
This was supposed to be the last time, last hit
Last call, last feel, last trip, last run
That's what I always tell myself, huh, damn
This was supposed to be the last one, last two
Last flip, last you, last me, last night
Doing every single thing my parents warned me about
(You're a fucking disappointment) 'Til I wore 'em out, shit

[Chorus]
Voices in my head saying I could do better
(Voices in my head saying that I could do better)
Voices in my head saying that I knew better
(Yeah, you know what's about to go down)
I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular
But I still, fuck
(That's your problem, you don't listen!)

Part 2: "Stick to the Plan"

[Bridge]
Voices in my head, conscience talking to me like
Look
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Chorus]
Stick to the plan, stick to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan, to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan

[Verse 1]
Stay focused
Don't let these niggas see your emotions
Stick to the notion, stay in motion
Remember soon as you stand still
So will everything else you notice
Make sure all your inner actions end with actions
If you stacking fronting and back in
Subtract if it isn't adding
Plus who hurt you don't let back in
Plan it out, yeah, tit for tat it
Extra pussy get distracted
Put that into what's worth having (boy)

[Chorus]
Stick to the plan, stick to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan, to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan

[Verse 2]
Stay focused
Pay attention who you getting close with
Distance yourself from negative energy
Voices in my head, they say it's meant for me
I, I, I, you in my way, bitch it's no sympathy
I, I, I, been plotting this since elementary
I, I, I, no you need to buckle down
Have people asking where you at
And wondering why you never wanna come around
You know that effort gon' come around
Big face like Zordon
You bought the watch but can't afford the time
Even if you running out of breath
Weight of the world doing lots of reps
Time to get this generation
Last one and then the next two outta debt
And they gon' pay you back with respect
Just stick to the plan, still, we can chill
Back when I rocked the white and blue Grant Hills
I realized there's no dream that I can't fill
I manifested all while I'm the man still
(Bitch I'm the man)

[Verse 3]
Voices in my head attacking what I'm thinking
Bullet to the head might be the way to free it
If I leave my body I can free the spirits
Swear to God my death of fear just keep on shrinking
Wishing I could go back to the nineties
Back when I was dreaming
Me and my dog was on a mission like we Kel and Kenan
Early 2000s Detroit might as well been the hell with demons
Wondering when I started losing it, the losing grip
Feeling like I'm in the middle of the ocean
You either drown or canoe through it
Voices in my head said I'm used to it
Some help me to lose and some help me maneuv' through it
When I talk to myself I'm confused on who's who it
I know in life you either blow it or blew it
And at the end of life, it's gonna feel like you flew through it
I just hope by then I cut the voices in my head

Bigger Than Me by Big Sean

[Intro: Big Sean]
Do or die
Look, all I wanna do is make the city proud, yeah
Wishing all the OGs could see me now, now, yeah
And when you feel something you can't see
But you know it's meant to be
You gon' realize that this is bigger than me yeah
Bigger than me, bigger than me
When the whole family depend on you to eat
And at night you can't sleep
You gon' realize that this is bigger than me

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Get it, get it, get it
I pray that you get it even if I can't get it with cha
I pray to God you never let the little things in life distract you from the bigger picture
Everybody in the city to me like a distant cousin, brother, little sister
I see myself in the young ones
When I look in their eyes it feel like a mirror
Corleone all on my own (Don)
Cartier all on my arm
All I hear is sirens  and car alarms
Niggas going to war with no armor on
First time I seen a dead body I was 14
And I felt the pressure
Like if I don't get it, I might end up next to him
I'ma take the dice and I'ma roll a 7
Seven, seven, seven, 7-11 it's 911 getting called around
The hood America's lost and found
Where niggas get lost and never found
All I ever wanted was to turn these Gs into Ms and a Mercedes key
Got it and I still felt incomplete
That's when I realized this shit was bigger than me

[Chorus: Big Sean & Flint Chozen Choir]
Bigger than me
When the whole town on their feet
And they all just waiting on you to speak
That's when you realize that this is bigger than me
All I wanna do is make the city proud, yeah
Wishing all the OGs could see me now, now, yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
You gon' realize that this was bigger than me

[Bridge: Starrah]
Used to want that foreign
Got that foreign, now it's boring
Started touring
Swear to God that's when I realized this shit was bigger than me
Flex on niggas with a Rollie
Got that Rollie with the shine
But lost my time
That's when I realized this shit was bigger than me

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I seen people in the same place 10 years later
Man that shit pathetic
God talking to me telepathic like it only happen if you let it
I can't spend my whole life looking at the same ceiling fan
When I feel like I ain't got no ceilings man
If I ain't special why I feel it then?
I gotta get on the road
I gotta be the one chose
I gotta come back and tell the greatest story they never told
This must be the feeling that you get when you know you close
And you know it's a way in even when the doors are closed
And realize this shit is bigger than me yeah

[Chorus: Big Sean & Flint Chozen Choir]
Bigger than me
When the whole town on their feet
And they all just waiting on you to speak
That's when you realize that this is bigger than me
All I wanna do is make the city proud, yeah
Wishing all the OGs could see me now, now, yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
Ohhh ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ohhh ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
Ohhh ya ya ya ya ya ya ya

[Outro]
[Myra Anderson:] Well no matter what, I'm proud of you. Even when you do stupid things that I have warned you about. You must get that from your daddy. I'm just kidding, you know I love you. You listening?
[Big Sean:] Yeah yeah, I'm listening. I love you too
[Myra Anderson:] In a way I feel like I'm living through you. Sometimes it feels like I got another chance at everything
[Big Sean:] Man that's deep to feel like that. I kinda feel the same way though sometimes
[Myra Anderson:] Yeah
[Big Sean:] With all the work that's goin' on I feel like this is like my second time doin' it so I know that sound crazy but, you know I just I don't know why I always imagine myself as like someone who failed at everything he ever did at life you know and I got to the end of life and just regretted it all and somehow, this is my chance to go back and get it all right. And when I wake up, with that mindset, you know, it completely changes my hunger, how I approach the whole day. I mean you decide to live your life like that then pshh, man I guarantee we'll live life to our best potential
[Big Sean (future self):] It's that simple. It's all about living in the moment. Period

I Miss You by Grey

[Verse 1]
I used to know you better, better than anyone
Now I don't know you at all
You used to keep my secrets, shallow has turned to deepness
Now I got someone else to call

[Pre-Chorus]
Just 'cause I don't make a thing about it
Don't mean that I never think about it, 'cause I do
Just 'cause I learned how to live without you
Don't mean that I ever really wanted to, oh

[Chorus]
I miss you, yeah, yeah
After all that we've been through
I never told you that I do
But I miss you, ooh
Even after all this time
I got your body on my mind
I miss you

[Verse 2]
This might seem out of nowhere, I get it if you don't care
Guess I just don't know what to say
Don't know if you remember that night in late September
For me, it feels like yesterday

[Pre-Chorus]
Just 'cause I don't make a thing about it
Don't mean that I never think about it, 'cause I do
Just 'cause I learned how to live without you
Don't mean that I ever really wanted to, oh

[Chorus]
I miss you, yeah, yeah
After all that we've been through
I never told you that I do
But I miss you, ooh
Even after all this time
I got your body on my mind

[Post-Chorus]
I miss you
Even after all this time, I got your body on my mind
I miss you
Even after all this time, I got your body on my mind

[Outro]
Even when I'm not trying to, I keep doing the things we do
Are you missing me too? Are you missing me too?
Like I miss you? Yeah, yeah
I miss you

When We Were Young by Adele

[Verse 1]
Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

[Pre-Chorus]
You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

[Verse 2]
I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me

[Pre-Chorus]
You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

[Refrain]
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)

[Bridge]
It's hard to admit that everything just takes me back
To when you were there, to when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on just in case it hasn't gone
'Cause I still care, do you still care?

[Breakdown]
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

[Refrain]
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)
(When we were young)

[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old, it makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young

Lamborghini doors when I lift off
They done fucked around, got a nigga pissed off
Nice little thot got a stiff arm
Did the Heisman on the hoe got the stiff arm
Fuck all that biting like Tyson or Holyfield
Woah whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
A couple of pills and I got my soda filled
Woah whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Break out a sweat, I go head over heels for these mils
Woah whoa whoa whoa whoa
She thinks she the one but to me she ain't nothing but a thrill
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
I've been drippin' like a God, what else?
I been dodgin' all the flage, what else?
I been fillin' up garages, what else?
I gave her her first ménage, what else?
Close your eyes eyes eyes
I'm about to slide slide slide
Wonder why why why
I stay in the sky sky sky
Pink molly, let me dance with her (yup)
Freestylin', let me dance with her
Sky Dweller, it was sentimental
Rose gold, it was cinnamon

[Verse 2]
Fucking my bitch by the change
Want me to jump out the stage
I wanna jump in the air
You know the love ain t fair
You killin' then show us the proof
I already got the juice
Chain different colors like fruits
I like to hang out the roof
I got to train my bitches
I'm putting chains on my bitches
I'll pull some chain on the snitches
I'm focused, I'm back on my mission
Flex on a nigga, no apologies
Molly off-white, done got to me
Playing hockey with the ice in the Major League
35 bitches at the St. Reg
Fall back shooter like KD
Back in the kitchen with Curry
Pullin' up wit Xan, can't hurt me
Pineapple drink lookin' syrupy
56 nights, I was dirty
Styrofoam cups servin' patients
Heard you been talkin' bout the kid
Knowin' damn well that s a flagrant (technical)
I cancel two bitches
I got me some new bitches
Come check out how I m living
I got me some new drippy
I got me some new drip!
She ain't got nothing to do with it
I'll give my bitch to you
If that what she mean to you

[Chorus]
Draco season with the bookbag
Rat tat, got a little kick back
Hundreds on hundreds, got a good batch
You ain't never ever get your bitch back
You ain't never ever get your bitch back
You ain't never ever get your bitch back
You ain't never ever get your bitch back
You ain't never ever get your bitch back
Draco season with the bookbag
Rat tat, got a little kick back
Hundreds on hundreds, got a good batch
You ain't never ever get your bitch back
You ain't never ever get your bitch back
You ain't never ever get your bitch back
You ain't never ever get your bitch back
You ain't never ever get your bitch back

[Verse 3]
Yacht cruisin' in the deep
I'm twisted up, I got geeked
Misbehaving with ya freak
Can't tell she got teeth
I was in her mouth like veneers
Stop comparing my career
Designer flooded through the crib
Bentley furniture for real
Bought a Fendi couch for my kids
They just want to plug a nigga wig
Charge a half a mil for the gig
Middle fingers up, fuck the pigs
Diamonds fallin' off me, let me jig
Never falling off and never quit
I retired cookin' up a brick
Certified nigga out the six
Who was wrapping dummies in the zone
I was chargin' 10 for the strong
Keep on goin' in on this song
Keep an F&N at your home
Lesson learned and we moving on
I got Firm niggas, Al Capone
Got my Chi niggas on the horn
Downtown Atlanta I was born

You know your body look good
So good, so good, yeah

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like

Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

Hypnotised by Coldplay

[Verse 1]
Been rusting in the rubble
Running to a faint
Need a brand new coat of paint
Found myself in trouble
Thinking about what ain't
Never gonna be a saint

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Saying float like an eagle
Fall like the rain
Pouring to put out the pain
Oh again and again

[Chorus]
Now I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I trip, when I look in your eyes
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotized
Yeah I slip and I'm mesmerized

[Verse 2]
It's easy to be lethal
I'm learning from the news
It's a guidebook for the blues
Saying it's the very same steeple
People want to choose
They just see it from different views

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And threading the needle
Fixing my flame
Oh now I'm moved to exclaim
Oh again, and again

[Chorus]
How I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I trip, when I look in your eyes
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotized
Yeah I lift and I'm mesmerized

[Outro]
Oh again, and again
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I lift to a permanent high
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotised
It was dark
Now it's sunrise

I'm in your waterfall
I'm in your waterfall

[Verse 1: P!nk]
Oh, I'm in the jungle now
You've been seekin', I've been hidin' out
Use your love, it scares me so deep down
You may find me, 'cause my heart beats loud, so loud
It beats fast, in the places where you touched me last
I can feel the burn my skin, it has
But the return of your beloved hands, hands

Breathe by Astrid S

[Intro]
I forget to

[Verse 1]
It's been a week since you hit my bed
And since then, you've started living in my head, eh
Seven days, and I'm nearly dead
Never thought that I'd reboot
But you're a different kind of new

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's like I feel everything more (I forget to)
All my body knows it when you reach my floor, eh
My heart is beating down the door
And now I'm stocking up on oxygen

[Chorus]
'Cause when I see you
I forget to bre-e-eathe
I forget to bre-e-eathe
I forget to bre-e-eathe
I forget to, when I'm with you
(I forget to)

[Verse 2]
If I could just inhale some chill
It's like I'm living out in space
How am I still here?
Did you slip me a magic pill?
Got me lifted like an astronaut
No helmet on and my lungs just stop

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So please, when you look at me like that
There's no way to fight back, no
Please, can't you see I'm stocking up on oxygen?

[Chorus]
'Cause when I see you
I forget to bre-e-eathe
I forget to bre-e-eathe
I forget to bre-e-eathe
I forget to, when I'm with you
When I see you, I forget to bre-e-eathe (I forget to)
I forget to bre-e-eathe (I forget to)
I forget to bre-e-eathe (I forget to)
I forget to, when I'm with you

I don't know how to live without the breath you finish
I don't know how to live without the breath you finish
I don't know how to live without the breath you finish
Give me it, give me it

[Chorus]
I forget to bre-e-eathe
I forget to bre-e-eathe
I forget to bre-e-eathe
I forget to, when I'm with you
When I see you, I forget to bre-e-eathe (I forget to)
I forget to bre-e-eathe (I forget to)
I forget to bre-e-eathe (I forget to)
I forget to, when I'm with you

Only You by Zara Larsson

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna shower, even if I stink
'Cause I don't wanna wash you off, wash you off my skin
It's been about an hour
And I'm still tremblin', oh
Feelin' you deep, feelin' you deep within
Eh-eh-eh, yeah-eh-eh

[Pre-Chorus]
Opened bottles on the drawer
Rollin' papers on the floor
Eh, don't want a cigarette yet
Don't want no drink on my breath, yes
Wanna taste your taste some more
Feel you pourin' through my pores
Eh, I'm goin' back in my bed to play it back in my head

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't love nobody like I love myself
Like I love myself, only you, ay
No one's ever touched me like I touch myself
No, nobody else, only you, only you
Only you

[Verse 2]
I feel you in my fingers, even in my toes
Steam upon the mirror and on the windows
Baby, that was it
Wish it would never end
I just wanna do it, do it again
Eh-eh-eh, yeah-eh-eh

[Pre-Chorus]
I can smell your smell, so sweet
On my pillow, on my sheets
Eh, I wanna keep it like that
Keep on sleepin' like that, yeah
Baby, you'll be hard to beat
What I have is yours to keep
Eh, I never wanted so bad, best that I ever had

[Chorus]
No, I can't love nobody like I love myself
Oh, like I love myself, only you, oh
No one's ever touched me like I touch myself
No, nobody else, only you, only you

[Bridge]
Only you
Only you
Only you
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
I can't love nobody like I love myself
Like I love myself, only you, only you
No one's ever touched me like I touch myself
No, nobody else (Nobody, nobody, nobody)
Only you (No, oh, only you)

Bloodstream by The Chainsmokers

[Verse 1]
I've been drunk three times this week
Spent all my money on a fleeting moment
I thought I-I-I-I-I-I can shake this off
Now I-I-I-I-I-I can't make this stop
Yeah, things were sweet three months ago
When I was living how I wanna on my own
And I thought I-I-I-I-I-I don't need that much
I guess I-I-I-I-I-I was out of touch

[Chorus]
I'm fucked up, I'm faded
I'm so complicated
Those things that I said
They were so overrated
But I-I-I-I-I-I, yeah, I meant it
Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it

Yeah, I meant it

[Verse 2]
I gave up three times this week
Went through those feelings
Like I wasn't worth nothing
I thought I-I-I-I-I-I can shake this off
No, I-I-I-I-I-I can't be this soft

[Chorus]
I'm fucked up, I'm faded
I'm so complicated
Those things that I said
They were so overrated
But I-I-I-I-I-I, yeah, I meant it
Oh yeah, I-I-I-I-I-I, really fucking meant it

Yeah, I meant it

Don't Say by The Chainsmokers

[Verse 1]
Droppin' bombs in cups of coffee
You said it hit you all at once
I'm already tired and it's still mornin'
Then you clear your throat
Deep down I know that this is done
You tell me you're sorry and I'm laughin'
You say sometimes these things just don't work out
'Cause you're only human, this shit happens
Wait, I don't mean to stop you
But darlin', I have to cut you off

[Chorus]
Don't say, don't say you're human
Don't say, don't say it's not your fault

Don't say, don't say
Don't say, don't say
Don't say you're human

Come on, admit you let me down
Say that I'm better in your absence
Go right ahead, say almost anything you want

Honest by The Chainsmokers

[Intro: Bono]
The other one is, of course, outing yourself
I think be the first to out yourself, I always think
Because, you know, there's no end to the hypocrisy of the human heart

Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah

[Verse 1]
It's 5 a.m. and I'm on the radio
I'm supposed to call you, but I don't know what to say at all
And there's this girl, she wants me to take her home
She don't really love me though, I'm just on the radio

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind

[Chorus]
If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest

[Verse 2]
It's 6 a.m., I'm so far away from you
I don't wanna let you down, what am I supposed to do?
It's been three weeks at least, now, since I've been gone
And I don't even like the road, I'm just on the radio

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind

Young by The Chainsmokers

[Verse 1]
Young
We were so young when we thought that we knew how to love
Fought about anything, everything led to dysfunction
But we just gotta own that shit
Don't let it go like this
Maybe we can grow from this, yeah

[Chorus]
We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out, like to meet up at the bar
Don't worry, my love, we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young

[Hook]
Yeah, it's hard when you're young

[Verse 2]
Caught, we were caught up in the high, it was better than drugs
Too high to see that it would all lead to destruction
At least we both know that shit
We just gotta own that shit
I hope that we can grow from this, yeah

[Chorus]
We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out, like to meet up at the bar
Don't worry, my love, we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young

[Hook]
Yeah, it's hard when you're young
Yeah, yeah, it's hard when you're young

(I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
Say what you want, but it's hard when you're young
I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
You say what you want, but it's hard when you're young)

[Chorus]
We both know I go too far like when I wrecked your car
And almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
And all those nights we snuck out, like to meet up at the bar
Don't worry, my love, we're learning to love
But it's hard when you're young

[Bridge]
I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
Say what you want, but it's hard when you're young
I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
You say what you want, but it's hard when you're young
I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
You say what you want, but it's hard when you're young

[Outro]
Yeah, it's hard when you're young
Yeah, it's hard when you're young
Yeah, oh, yeah, it's hard when you're young
I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
You say what you want, but it's hard when you're young
I'm calling you up, you tell me it's over
You say what you want, but it's hard when you're young

I'm with the gang, gang, gang and we 'bout to go up
Switching lanes, it's a thang, every time we show up
You a lame, lame, lame and you so below us

Ended up independent
Took my car to the clinic
Let 'em check all the vitals
Middle finger to rivals
Michael Jackson, my idol
Still ducked in a pie hole
Talk to the plug, every day except Cinco de Mayo
I still got me a Carlo
Still got money, Carlo
Your car running so bad, it stink up the Apollo
Call my Rollie a Ralo
Call my AP a "ap"
I ain't talking seat-belts when I say that I'm strapped
I'm in love with my side ho
I'll sneak her through the side door
I'ma show you what we ride for
I'ma show you what we die for

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I'm with the gang, gang, gang and we 'bout to go up

We stay down
And came up, and came up
We stay down
We came up, the gang up

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I'm in my same lane, lane and I ain't gon' ever change up
I blow the brain out the range like a Taz Angel
Here's R.I.P. to Paul Walker, homie got his stain up
We had your main on us, now we got stains on us
And all we gotta do is stay down and come up while they flexin' (What we gotta do?)
Yeah, I got her Indian and she Western
Yeah, I just had sex with one of your best friends
Then that fast and furious started nesting
Say I'm 'bout to go take off on you (Take off on you)
Is you staying, is you rolling like a scroller? Yes, you are
You're ready to take off like a 1980 Coke
He know that Instagram shit, are you gon' post that?

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I'm with the gang, gang, gang and we 'bout to go up
Switching lanes, it's a thang, every time we show up
You a lame, lame, lame and you so below us
Bet your ho, she know us
'Cause you know we blowed up
We stay down
And came up, and came up
We stay down
We came up, the gang up

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, I'm always with my gang
We always ready to ride 'cause for the squad, we'll do anything
Stay down, we'll never change
We always gon' stay the same
Put you in check, when you outta place
I try to tell 'em not to mess with my gang, gang, gang
We do what we gotta do and don't complain-plain-plain
I'm on the road, I'm probably fresh up off the plane, plane, plane
Know you heard about me, I do my thang, thang, thang
I got the world on my back
I put your girl on her back
I did it all on my own
Now there ain't no turning back
And my whole squad got my back
And shawty so bad, I asked her if she repped the gang, she said "Facts"
Gang, gang, gang

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
I'm with the gang, gang, gang and we 'bout to go up
Switching lanes, it's a thang, every time we show up
You a lame, lame, lame and you so below us
Bet your ho, she know us
'Cause you know we blowed up
We stay down
And came up, and came up
We stay down
We came up, the gang up

[Verse 1]
Real shit goin' on in Lebanon
But I don t give a fuck, my favorite show is coming on
Hashtag pray for this, pray for that
But you ain t doing shit, get away from that
Blame it on a black, blame it on a white
Blame it on a gun, blame it on a Muslim
Everybody wanna blame him, blame her
Just blame it on a mothafucka killing everyone!
Everybody wanna get high
Everybody wanna live life like they can t die
Everybody gotta be right
Everybody scrollin', scrollin' through they life
I wish they would love me like I like they pictures
I wish I had bitches
I wish I had motivation to get money
Ain t it funny, my rainy day would be sunny
If I had the vision of currency fallin' above from the sky
Fallin' above from the sky, listen up
Everybody looking for the meaning of life through a cell phone screen
Everybody looking for the meaning of life through a cell phone screen
Everybody think that the meaning of life is, life is
Everybody, everybody, woo
Everybody think that the meaning of life is

[Verse 2: Ansel Elgort]
Oh, I know it s hard, I know it s hard like
I know that s the reason you turn up at night
Livin' yo' life, just livin' yo' life
Can t nobody tell you how to do it right
Come away with me, come away with me
Let me take you from this world of insanity
Come away with me, come away with me
Far away from flying bullets on this killing spree
Oh, I know, I know
It s hard, yeah, it s hard, yeah, yeah
I know it s hard sometimes
It s hard sometimes

Confess by Logic

[Verse 1]
I want what I want how I want when I want it
I ma keep it a hunnid, I m blunted
I don t give a damn, I don t give a fuck about another man
Fuck a brother man
I ma make it, make it rain like the weather man
Old girl shoulda, shoulda got a better man
Ass fat, lookin' good in my letterman
In the hood I m a better man
Wish a mothafucka would, would
Whole life I been up to no good
Change it all if I could
Rearrange my heart, the beat good but I can t
I m a sinner, not a saint
Layers to my life, no I can t
Cover it up with paint
Keep on livin', livin'
Livin' on money and women
As soon as I m in 'em, I m out
Now the truth never come out my mouth
Speak life when I come in her mouth, like

[Refrain]
I m a dirty mothafucka, a waste of life, a waste of skin
Wanna repent, don t know where to begin
Next of kin don t give a damn 'bout me
I know God don t give a damn 'bout me
People try but don t know 'bout me
But the Devil said that he want my soul
But the Devil said that he want my soul
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now

[Chorus]
Somebody save me
I need you to save me
To wash away my sins on high

[Verse 2]
I d rather be a different man in another world
Than work for the man in my universe
Wonder what it feel like to take flight
Momma told me everything gon' be alright
I mean my life can t be off right
But come to think about it
Everybody runnin' the world seem to be all white
Can you mothafuckas see alright?
I mean, I need it, I want it, I gotta have it
Every day tragic
If you re from where I m from, everyday ain t magic
On this I know
I been telling everybody I ma give it a go, I know
I been there before, feel it in my soul, oh I know!
Love it or hate it, I made it
I did it, I lived it
While the whole world lookin' at the boy like whoa!
Baptized in a ocean of Hennessey
Really wonder what the remedy
Tell me, how the world gon' remember me?
Got me feelin like the enemy
Like I ain t got no energy
I been lookin' for an entity
Feelin' like I need to chill, like I need a new amenity
Fuck all that

[Refrain]
I m a dirty mothafucka, a waste of life
A waste of skin
Wanna repent, don t know where to begin
Next of kin don t give a damn 'bout me
I know God don t give a damn 'bout me
People try but don t know 'bout me
But the Devil said that he want my soul
But the Devil said that he want my soul
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now

[Chorus]
Somebody save me
I need you to save me
To wash away my sins on high

[Bridge]
I know my life was lived the wrong way
I know I did you wrong in my own way
But it was the flashing lights that mesmerized
That hypnotized the only
Part of me you loved
Part of me that had the strength to rise above
Part of me you know
Part of me you love more than to let it go

[Outro: Killer Mike]
Dear God, I just wanna know why
Why do you put us here?
Why do you put us below?
Why do you put us subservient?
Why do you put us below these evil motherfuckers?
And then we crawl and we scratch our way out
We betray each other
We lie, we take from one another
And we told you gon' forgive us at the end
But the state don't forgive us
I'm locked up and half my friends
And then when I get out, or I make it out
I'm expected to somehow give back
To people who never wanted to see me escape
I'm startin' to hate the man in the mirror
And it's gettin' clearer
That society was designed to keep me on the bottom
So, if you real, if you're out there for real
Please explain to me why
Why do we suffer? Why do we die?
And why do the people
Who go against everything you ever said always get ahead?
I've done so much wrong, I don't know if I can ever be right
But tonight, I am in this church
Asking you to show yourself, to reveal yourself to me
Because I'm tired and I don't know what else to do
So black I'm blue, so brown I'm down
I done been everywhere but up, and when I finally get up
I am ravaged with guilt and pain and shame
And all I wanna do is believe in you
The darker you are, the closer you are to dirt
And they make sure it hurts
And I am tired of hurtin', man
I'm tired of bein' looked at, second guessed, doubted, feared
So if you out there, do something about this
'Cause I can't take it no more
Help me

Take It Back by Logic

[Chorus]
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black man
Long ago before the white man
Could paint the black man with a gun in his hand
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first white man
At the very moment when they looked around and said
"Fuck it, I ma steal this land"
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way way back to the first black man
Long ago before the white man
Could paint the black man with a gun in his hand
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first white man
At the very moment when they looked around and said
"Fuck it, I ma steal this land"

[Verse 1]
Everybody wanna tell me what I am, what I am not
"You ain't black, you a mothafuckin' white boy
Shut ya mouth, do it right boy, a'ight boy?
Man, why you such a hype boy?"
"Why you always talk about being black?
Skin too white, nigga fuck that"
Everything you talk about, cut that
That door you trying to open, you could shut that
Grip the gat, yeah that s how I ma buck back
Tell me what I am and what I know now
All this prejudice has got to go
Life is moving fast, it need to slow down
Come and see me when I am in yo' town
Practice what we preach before it go down
Practice what we preach before it go
Yes, I got the gift to gab fo sho
Will I have to get the gat? No, no
Yes, I got to gift to gab fo sho
But will have to get the gat, get the gat, get the, get the?
Masta deep down inside of me
The plantation deep down inside of me
Everybody fuck like sodomy
'Cause one or the other what it gotta be
Tell me why my momma gotta lie to me
Unity for everyone that lied to me
Peace on Earth what I try to be
I just wanna spread the message of equality
And yes, I got to gift to gab fo sho
Will I have to get the gat? No, no
Yes, I got to gift to gab fo sho
But will have to get the gat, get the gat, get the, get the gat?

[Chorus]
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black man
Long ago before the white man
Could paint the black man with a gun in his hand
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first white man
At the very moment when they looked around and said
"Fuck it, I ma steal this land"
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way way back to the first black man
Long ago before the white man
Could paint the black man with a gun in his hand
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way way back to the first white man
At the very moment when they looked around and said
"Fuck it, I ma steal this land"

[Outro]
Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to about 1990
Shady Grove Hospital in Rockville, Maryland
7:36 a.m., where a biracial baby was born
To a black father and a white mother
Father that wasn t there
Addicted to crack cocaine, alcohol, and various other drugs
Same as his mom
(Way, way back)
So I m gonna tell you about that, right?
And I m gonna tell you about how
All this young boy ever wanted was happiness
All he ever wanted was positivity
All he ever wanted to do was entertain
And this boy went through hell
You gotta understand, his mother was racist, which is crazy
'Cause how in the fuck is you gonna have
All these black babies with black men but you racist
Like bitch, that don t make no sense, but it is what it is
You know, he grew up, her callin' him a nigger
The kids at school callin' him a cracker
Identifying as black, looking as white
Being told what you can or can t be
This kid went through everything
He went through...
He saw narcotics in the household
Violence, murderers, drug dealers, he was kidnapped
There was crazy shit that happened to this kid
And he persevered while the whole world said
What they said?
Said you wouldn t be shit!
You ain t gon' be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothing
And I, and he, he said fuck that, I ma persevere
And that s why the message is always peace, love and positivity
See, he always saw things from two sides
He always saw things from two sides
He always knew that the message
Everybody was born equal
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
He knew that because he saw that
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way)
Because he was stripped and torn down
By his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated
And that did not know
And he was stripped and he was torn down
By his white side that did not know
These people that are ignorant
That cannot see the bigger picture
That must fight and kill and murder each other
But once again, all he ever wanted to do
Was spread a message of equality
For every man, woman, and child
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first)
Now imagine this child growing up
And seeing the craziest shit
Being a part of the craziest shit
Running around with the wrong people
Running around with guns and knives
And fighting and stealing and, and all this
Because he didn t know, he didn t know!
But he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn t right
And he knew that he needed to get away from it
Now I want you to also imagine, that at 17 years old
This child, okay, leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself
Two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings
And then he would then come home
To about eight or nine hours of sleep
But spend four, five, six hours of that
Working on music, persevering
Grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror
And pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people
Just chanting his name
Hoping that it would happen
But the, but the, but the world said no!
Mothafucka, little mothafucka no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no
Ya nigga, ya cracka, ya white boy, ya black mothafucka
No-no!
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first)
And he said fuck that
He said peace, love, and positivity
He said equality for all man
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation, yeah
Now I want you to also imagine
People telling him that he did not live this life
 You just a white boy
You ain t never experienced that shit
You from Gaithersburg, Maryland, nothing happens there
Oh no, no, we know, we weren t there
We didn t live with you, we didn't live in your Section 8 household
We didn t live with the narcotics and violence in your household
We just saw it from the outside, outside, outside, outside
Outside, outside, outside, outside
And since you white, you gotta have money, right? 
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black man)
And this young man persevered in spite
Of what people told him he was, wasn t, and would never be
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black)
And that man is here today, proud
A lover of all human beings
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, sexual orientation, yeah, yeah
And he s here to say:
Even though we re all born and created equal
We are not treated equally
There s extremists on every side
And you should just do your best to live life
And let other people believe whatever they wanna believe
As long as they re not hurtin' anybody
You can believe they re going to hell
You can believe it s not right
You can believe you re superior, fine
Just stop killing each other

Fight the power, fight the power
Fight for the right to get up and say fuck white power
Everybody come and get up, get on
And no matter what you fighting for I promise that it ll live on
Like make America great again
Make it hate again
Make it white
Make everybody fight
Fuck that
Street s disciple
My raps are trifle
I shoot slugs from my brain just like Cobain
And everybody wonder why the world insane

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
The world going mad over one drug
I'm filling up a bag at the gun club
In the shadow of a nation that it once was
All this false information I'ma unplug, young blood
It is not love, up at TrumpThugs, dot gov
The man in the high castle in a hot tub
We locked in a pine casket, it's botched up
Like plastic surgery, classic perjury
The way they can plead the fifth to the 13th
And stop to search me, controversy
Them boys in the klansmen hoods is thirsty but hey motherfucker

[Chorus: Logic]
Hey mothafucka, I m real as shit
Everything I m talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit
Aw yeah, I m back in this bitch
And you don t gotta like it but get off my dick

[Verse 3: Chuck D]
Young blood, it takes another look and feel
Slap that fear monger at that wheel
Olive branches in the arrow seal
Alternative facts mean to lie and steal
Gotta to go to ban the whole
Refugee population from the land they stole
In the name of the government
Rich white man while the rest be suffering
Run from the locked down borders
Ain t like Flint ain t got clean water
Dirty politics never come clean
Can ya'll believe this shit in 2017?

[Chorus: Logic]
Hey mothafucka, I m real as shit
Everything I m talkin' 'bout real as, real as shit
Aw yeah, I m back in this bitch
And you don t gotta like it but get off my, off my dick

[Verse 4: Logic]
George bush don't care about black people
2017 and Donald trump is the sequel so
Shit, I'll say what Kanye won't
Wake the fuck up and give the people what they want
Man it's all love but the youth is confused
Your music is 20/20 but them political views
Is blurred I ain't trying leave ya name slurred
'Cause honestly I idolize you on everything, my word
But I gotta say what need be said
'Cause I ain't fuckin with that hat, with the colors that s white and red
I know some people wish I d act white instead
Say I d use my pigment as a manifestation to get ahead
Fuck that, everything I do, I do it right
To teach the people that they have the power to fight
And not with semi automatic bullets in the night
So everybody, everywhere, listen to this fact
Nobody treated equally, especially the black
If you don t get it the first time, bring it back
Now, everybody gotta fight for equal rights
'Cause the richest people in the whole world equal whites
To make it happen though we gon' need patience
And not violence, giving hospitals more patients now
Don't burn down the mom and pop shop
I'm just as angry another person got shot
Don t be angry at the color of they skin
Just be happy that as a people we could begin again, and
I ma tell you what I need right now
I ma tell you what we all need
I need my people of color...
Don t run from Trump, run against him

Hey mothafucka I m real as shit

Everything I m talkin' 'bout real as shit

I been in the cut, liquor in my cup, 38 tuck
I don t give a fuck, I don t give a damn
I just wanna live, I just wanna eat
But I gotta do it for the hood, do it, do it for the street, uh
Dope in the trunk
Creepin out the cut
9 by the gut
Never get enough
I don t give a fuck
Stupid mothafuckas move backwards
Mastered the hustle
Something in the duffle for you bastards
Grind over chatter
Cheese on my mind like a packer
Only thing that matter, bitch scatter
You in my way, about to spray, the A-K
Middle of the day, like that shit s okay
Never had a job, never had a education
Only know probation
Never had a job never had a education
Yeah, I never had chance in this world, I never had one
No, I never had a chance in this world, I was labeled a bad one

[Interlude: No I.D. & Logic]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Now send the blacks back to Africa
Build a wall for the Mexicans
Send the whites back to Europe
Give the land to the Native American

Eyes Closed by Halsey

[Verse 1]
I, I know where to lay
I know what to say
It's all the same
And I, I know how to play
I know this game
It's all the same

[Chorus]
Now if I keep my eyes closed, he looks just like you
But he'll never stay, they never do
Now if I keep my eyes closed, he feels just like you
But you've been replaced
I'm face to face with someone new

[Verse 2]
Would've gave it all for you, cared for you
So tell me where I went wrong
Would've gave it all for you, cared for you
(My lover, my liar)
Would've traded all for you, there for you
So tell me how to move on
Would've traded all for you, cared for you
(My lover, my liar)

[Chorus]
Now if I keep my eyes closed, he looks just like you
But he'll never stay, they never do
Now if I keep my eyes closed, he feels just like you
But you've been replaced
I'm face to face with someone new

[Bridge]
He don't realize that I'm thinkin' about you
It's nothing new, it's nothing new

[Chorus]
Now if I keep my eyes closed, he looks just like you
But he'll never stay, they never do
Now if I keep my eyes closed, he feels just like you
But you've been replaced

Happy ending with a money menage
Me, dirt broke, that s a money mirage

Everybody wanna know what I devise
Everybody wanna know, yeah
Got a new vision, everybody listen
Fuck around I got a new religion
What it is, what it isn t, all of that revision
Get the fuck up out that prison
It s obvious the body is the cracker
The worse it is, what hurts it is, the blacker
Everybody actin' like the brain don t matter
Mind over matter unless we talkin' brain matter
Actin like you never seen a ass way fatter
Bitch way badder, mind in the gutter
Food for thought, yeah that s the plan with the butter
Talkin' shit, ya get hit like what up?

Let a mothafucka like this live, like, like
Made in the image of God, can you feel the vibe?
Mothafucka is you ready to ride? Is you ready to die?
Like B.I.G. the V.I.P
The greatest of all time, I ll be Ali
See, I be
The cost of livin', it ain t free
See, the tab on me
Feelin  like the man got tabs on me
Wonder if I only had rags on me
Would ya love me, want me?
Here with this, I know
Funny thing is I don t even know
All I get to have and all I have to give
Is what my God will give
Yeah, lemme show 'em what I gotta give

Your way, do it your way
Do it your way, do it

[Outro]
This is beyond the flesh, this is beyond the flesh
This is from the soul and for the soul
This is for all my brothers and sisters, for all my children
This is for every race
This is for every color, every creed
Music does not discriminate, music is made to assimilate
Black is beautiful, black is beautiful, and so are you
Strollin' down the highway, I m strollin'
And I was strollin' down the highway
Strollin', strollin', strollin', strollin'
I was strollin' down the highway
With my mind ablaze
Strollin' down the highway
For days and days
Strollin' down the highway
With my mind ablaze
Strollin' down the highway
For days and days and days and days

[Skit]
Hello?
I know, I know, I m supposed to been home, I m coming
Just, I m on my way home, every time
I m on my way there right now, okay?
Oh shit!
Life, what s it all about?
What? Wait, where am I?
The space between spaces
Beyond time and existential intelligence
Forget, fuck all the hippy shit, where am I?
What s the last thing you remember, Atom?
I was in the store, I bought some smokes
I came outside, the phone rang, I...
How do you know my name?!
You were walking home from work when you died
Died? Dead? I m dead? I m dead?!
It wasn t an act of courage or bravery, but it was your time
What do you mean it s my time? What? I got...
What about Vanessa? What about the baby?
Your wife and son? You see, that s what I like to hear
You find out you re dead and the first thing you worry about is others
Man, answer me, what about my family?
What s going on with Vanessa?
They re doing just fine
You see, your wife was cheating on you
Wait, wait, the bitch did what?!
And even though she loved you dearly
She was a bit relieved you would never find out
Wait, what the fuck you mean she cheated on me?
How you gon' tell me I m dead then gon' tell me my wife cheated on me?!
Atom, none of that matters now
Walk with me
Wait, what is this? Is this...Is this heaven?
No
Well, I don t see no pitchforks
Little red people runnin' around
It ain t too hot up in here so I guess this ain t hell either
I think the easiest way to describe it, this white void
Is to look upon it as a waiting room
So...are you God?
Yes, I m God

Meet Me in the Hallway by Harry Styles

[Intro]
Two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Meet me in the hallway, meet me in the hallway
I just left your bedroom, give me some morphine
Is there any more to do?

[Chorus]
Just let me know, I'll be at the door, at the door
Hoping you'll come around
Just let me know I'll be on the floor, on the floor
Maybe we'll work it out
I gotta get better, gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get better
And maybe we'll work it out

[Verse 2]
I walked the streets all day, running with the thieves
'Cause you left me in the hallway (Give me some more)
Just take the pain away

[Chorus]
Just let me know, I'll be at the door, at the door
Hoping you'll come around
Just let me know, I'll be on the floor, on the floor
Maybe we'll work it out
I gotta get better, gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get better
And maybe we'll work it out

[Outro]
We don't talk about it, it's something we don't do
'Cause once you go without it, nothing else will do

Ever Since New York by Harry Styles

[Verse 1]
Tell me something, tell me something
You don t know nothing, just pretend you do
I need something, tell me something new
Choose your words, 'cause there's no antidote
For this curse, oh, what's it waiting for?
Must this hurt you just before you go?

[Chorus]
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know

[Verse 2]
Brooklyn saw me, empty at the news
There's no water inside this swimming pool
Almost over, had enough from you
I've been praying, I never did before
Understand I'm talking to the walls
I've been praying ever since New York

[Chorus]
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know

[Bridge]
Tell me something, tell me something
You don t know nothing, just pretend you do
Tell me something just before you go

[Chorus]
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know

Woman by Harry Styles

[Intro]
Should we just search romantic comedies on Netflix and then see what we find?

[Verse 1]
I'm selfish, I know
But I don't ever want to see you with him
I'm selfish, I know
I told you, but I know you never listen

[Pre-Chorus]
I hope you can see, the shape that I'm in
While he's touching your skin
He's right where I should, where I should be
But you're making me bleed

[Chorus]
Woman, woman (la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Wo-woman, woman
Woman, woman (la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Wo-woman, woman (hey!)

[Verse 2]
Tempted, you know
Apologies are never gonna fix this (mmmm)
I'm empty, I know
And promises are broken like a stitch is

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I hope you can see, the shape I've been in
While he's touching your skin
This thing upon me, howls like a beast
You flower, you feast

[Chorus]
Woman (ah, ah, ah), woman (la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Wo-woman (mmmmm), woman
Woman (dah-duh-dum, dah-duh-dum, dah-dah-dum), woman (la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Wo-woman (mmmmm), woman

Only Angel by Harry Styles

[Intro]
I saw this angel
I really saw an angel

[Verse 1]
Open up your eyes, shut your mouth and see
That I'm still the only one who's been in love with me
I'm just happy getting you stuck in between my teeth
And there's nothing I can do about it
Broke a finger knocking on your bedroom door
I got splinters in my knuckles crawling across the floor
Couldn't take you home to mother in a skirt that short
But I think that's what I like about it

[Chorus]
She's an angel
Only angel
She's an angel
My only angel

[Verse 2]
I must admit I thought I'd like to make you mine
As I went about my business through the warning signs
End up meeting in the hallway every single time
And there's nothing we can do about it
Told it to her brother and she told it to me
That she's gonna be an angel, just you wait and see
When it turns out she's a devil in between the sheets
And there's nothing she can do about it
Hey, hey

[Chorus]
She's an angel
Only angel
She's an angel
My only angel
She's an angel
Only angel
She's an angel
My only angel

[Bridge]
(Ooh, ooh, ah-ah)
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight
Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight
Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight

[Chorus]
She's an angel
Only angel
She's an angel
My only angel
She's an angel
Only angel
She's an angel
My-my-my only angel

From the Dining Table by Harry Styles

[Verse 1]
Woke up alone in this hotel room
Played with myself, where were you?
Fell back to sleep, I got drunk by noon
I've never felt less cool

[Chorus]
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever be the first one to break?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way

[Verse 2]
I saw your friend that you know from work
He said you feel just fine
I see you gave him my old t-shirt
More of what was once mine

[Chorus]
I see it's written, it's all over his face
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever say what you want to say?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way

[Bridge]
Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
But you, you never do
Woke up the girl who looked just like you
I almost said your name

[Chorus]
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever say what you want to say?
Even my phone misses your call
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever say what you want to say?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way

Told You So by Paramore

[Verse 1]
For all I know
The best is over and the worst is yet to come
Is it enough
To keep on hoping when the rest have given up
And they go

[Chorus]
"I hate to say I told you so"
They love to say they told me so
"I hate to say I told you so"
They love to say they told me

[Post-Chorus]
Say they say they told me
Say they say they told me
You say, you say you told me

[Verse 2]
I know you like
When I admit that I was wrong and you were right
At least I try
To keep my cool when I'm thrown into a fire
And they go

[Chorus]
"I hate to say I told you so"
They love to say they told me so
"I hate to say I told you so"
They love to say they told me

[Post-Chorus]
Say they say they told me
Say they say they told me
We say you say you told me

[Bridge]
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again

[Chorus]
"I hate to say I told you so"
They love to say they told me so
"I hate to say I told you so"
They love to say they told me

[Post-Chorus]
Say they say they told me
Say they say they told me
You say, you say you told me

Switch by Iggy Azalea

[Intro: Iggy Azalea & Anitta]
Uh
It's Iggy Iggs!
What you want
Look, look

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Kick in the door, wavin' the four fizzy
They already know they can't fuck with Iggy
True's cost more than the rent do, you know that
All black on when I come through, it's Kodak
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Is Iggy the ziggy-iggy the baddest of 'em all?
Why you come through, shut down the mall?
All that ass deserve an applause

[Pre-Chorus: Anitta & Iggy Azalea]
Change the game (Change it up, change it up now)
Switchin' up the game (Switch it up, switch it up now)
There I go again (Here we go, here we go)
Play your role, play you ro-o-ole
Fantasy (Fantasy)
Turns reality (Turn reality)
Right in front of me (Right in front of me)
I can have it anyway I want

[Chorus: Iggy Azalea & Anitta]
Red light, yellow light, green light, switch! (Ooh)
This is 'bout that time you recognize that I'm that bitch
This is all that sauce your mama said you couldn't get
Red light, yellow light, green light, switch! (Ooh)

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
Me and my boo on a worldwide hustle
You know what it is when I flex that muscle
I don't even know what a real one do
Talk that talk, I can back it up too
Got yo dessert, call me the waiter
I'm flirtin', you get it later
You could get it from the inside out
No hands, you could put it in your mouth

[Pre-Chorus: Anitta & Iggy Azalea]
Change the game (Change it up, change it up now)
Switchin' up the game (Switch it up, switch it up now)
There I go again (Here we go, here we go)
Play your role, play you ro-o-ole
Fantasy (Fantasy)
Turns reality (Turn reality)
Right in front of me (Right in front of me)
I can have it anyway I want

[Chorus: Iggy Azalea & Anitta]
Red light, yellow light, green light, switch! (Ooh)
This is 'bout that time you recognize that I'm that bitch
This is all that sauce your mama said you couldn't get
Red light, yellow light, green light, switch! (Ooh)

[Bridge: Iggy Azalea]
Uh, it's Iggy bitches
What you want?
What you want, want, want?

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Switch it up, the Lamb, the Bentley truck
He don't love you, that ring ain't big enough
If they talkin' that money I'm showing up
My account getting bigger, it's growing up
And I'm still a ma'fuckin' rockstar
Popstar but I roll with the mobsters
Yacht club on the shore eating lobster
While I'm stunting in Geneva with my top off

[Chorus: Iggy Azalea & Anitta]
Red light, yellow light, green light, switch! (Ooh)
This is 'bout that time you recognize that I'm that bitch
This is all that sauce your mama said you couldn't get
Red light, yellow light, green light, switch! (Ooh)
Red light, yellow light, green light, switch! (Switch it up on 'em)
This is about the time you recognize I'm that bitch
This is all that sauce your mama said you couldn't get
Red light, yellow light, green light, switch! (Switch it up on 'em)

Uh, she beat her face up with that new Chanel
She like the price, she see the ice, it make her coochie melt
When I met her in the club I asked her who she felt
Then she went and put that booty on that Gucci belt
We don't got no label
She say she want bottles, she ain't got no table
She don't got no bed frame, she don't got no tables
We just watchin' Netflix, she ain't got no cable, okay though

Lookin' for the one?
Well, bitch, you're lookin' at the one
I'm the best yet, and yet my best is yet to come
'Cause I've been lookin' for somebody
Not just any fuckin' body
Don't make me catch a body
That's for any and everybody
Oh my God, she hit me up all day, get no response
Bitch, you blow my high
That's like turnin' gold to bronze, roll my eyes
And when she on the molly, she a zombie
She think we Clyde and Bonnie
But it's more like Whitney and Bobby
God, forgive me! Tunechi F finessin', I'm a legend

Thunder by Imagine Dragons

[Verse 1]
Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind
Not a "Yes, sir," not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

[Pre-Chorus]
Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

[Chorus]
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning and the thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning and the thunder, thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder (Thun-, thun-)

[Verse 2]
Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say, "You're basic," they say, "You're easy"
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nosebleeds

[Pre-Chorus]
Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

[Chorus]
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning and the thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning and the thunder, thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder (Thun-, thun-)

[Bridge]
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder

Believer by Imagine Dragons

[Verse 1]
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

[Chorus]
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Verse 2]
Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was chokin' in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

[Chorus]
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Bridge]
Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

[Chorus]
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Intro: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'

[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I'm with all my niggas, I don't go nowhere without 'em
If they don't let us in they might throw shots at the bouncer
Actavis medicine, got it straight from out the doctor's
I'm with RJ but I call him Wayne 'cause he's a shotta
Pick up the ladder, put it in the gun, make the 9 stretch
Niggas with attitude, but we come straight out of Highbridge
I'm gon' make her panties wet when she see the way I flex
I'm gon' win a Grammy, move my family out the projects
We went from chillin' in the projects to makin' projects
We was tryna get to the top, and they tried to stop us
I talk for myself, bitch I don't need no fucking voucher
She looked at my wrist and she looked at a hundred thousand

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Just bought a brand new chain from Avianne
Nigga with attitude but I ain't from Compton
Lil Kodak, bitch, I'm Polo'd down like Carlton
Sniper Gang I put a nigga on a carton
I'm the shit I'm fartin', I don't know how to potty
Pull up in a 'Rari, I'm in the Yo like Gotti
A Boogie, I'm goin Scottie, nigga drop my deposit
I ain't Jamaican, bitch I'm Haitian, but I got them shottas
Harley Davidson every day, I'm ridin' with the chopper
They hatin', I know they don't wanna see a nigga prosper
I ain't doing trims, I'm in the cut like I'm a barber
She call me daddy, but I ain't her motherfucking father

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'

Reminding Me by Shawn Hook

[Chorus: Shawn Hook, Vanessa Hudgens & Both]
She keeps reminding me
That you re still gone
And I m still lonely
He keeps reminding me
How good it was
When we were crazy

[Verse 1: Shawn Hook]
Wine, she s spitting out the wine
I forgot you left behind
Our favorite cherry red
Oh, love, I know this isn t love
'Cause I m still thinking of you
While she s getting undressed
I never should have left

[Chorus: Shawn Hook]
She keeps reminding me
That you re still gone
And I m still lonely
She keeps reminding me
How good it was
When we were crazy

[Post-Chorus: Shawn Hook]
In love, love
She keeps reminding me
How good it was, was
She keeps reminding me

[Verse 2: Vanessa Hudgens]
Nights, I miss the faded nights
Staying out 'til morning light
Having breakfast in bed
Now he, he's laying in the sheets
The ones you bought for me
All tangled in a mess
It should be you instead

[Chorus: Shawn Hook & Vanessa Hudgens]
He keeps reminding me
That you re still gone
And I m still lonely
He keeps reminding me how good it was
When we were crazy

[Post-Chorus]
In love, love
He keeps reminding me
How good it was, was
He keeps reminding me

[Bridge: Shawn Hook & Vanessa Hudgens]
Well, I m tryna forget you with no regrets
But I m still hanging onto the memories that you left
I deleted your number with every text
I m still tryna forget you, forget you

[Chorus: Shawn Hook, Vanessa Hudgens & Both]
She keeps reminding me
That you re still gone
And I m still lonely
He keeps reminding me
How good it was
When we were crazy
She keeps reminding me
That you re still gone
And I m still lonely
He keeps reminding me
How good it was
When we were crazy

[Post-Chorus: Shawn Hook & Vanessa Hudgens]
In love, love
She keeps reminding me
How good it was, was
She keeps reminding me

[Outro: Shawn Hook]
Wine, she s spitting out the wine
I forgot you left behind

Whatever It Takes by Imagine Dragons

[Verse 1]
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Verse 2]
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system; a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Mask Off - Remix by Future

[Intro: Future]
Call it how it is
Hendrix
I promise, I swear, I swear
If Young Metro don't trust you, I m gon' shoot you
You heard, spit it, yo

[Chorus: Future]
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Don't chase no bitches

[Verse 1: Future]
Two cups, toast up with the gang
From food stamps to a whole 'nother domain
Out the bottom, I'm the livin' proof (super)
Ain't compromising, half a million on a coupe
Drug houses, lookin' like Peru
Graduated, I was overdue
Pink molly, I can barely move
Ask about me, I'm gon' bust a move
Rick James, thirty-three chains
Ocean air, cruisin' Biscayne
Top off, that s a liability
Hit the gas, boostin' my adrenaline

[Chorus: Future]
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Percocets, Molly, Percocets
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Don't chase no bitches

DJ EscoMoe City

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, I got a halo
I level up every time God say so
Shooter on payroll
Lookin' like Pancho, lookin' like Pedro
Money tree from Tarzan
Ten dividends gon' grow when I say "grow"
Kung Fu Kenny with the Midas touch
Ain't no penny that I don't touch
All my enemy bite on dust
Ain't no talkin' when it's fatal
Havin' heart, I can't tell
Half of y'all might need help
I might fall in Rodeo (bitch)
I might ball in Australia (say no more)
I might call her for real (say no more)
All the ass gon' unveil
Wind blows in the windows
And I snuck in when the vent close
She copy like 10-4
Know who we sent for
Platinum, platinum, platinum
Gotta look at self and ask what happened
How y'all let a conscious nigga go commercial
While only makin' conscious albums?
How y'all let the braids on TV?
How y'all let the hood at the table?
Now y'all don't even know how to rate him
Niggas lookin' like I'm a created player
Everybody who didn't pay respect
Gotta 'fess up now and pay ya debts
Gotta lay somethin' down if makin' threats
Gotta say somethin' now, don't hold ya breath
I mean, I'm floatin', I got the sauce, got the potion
I got 'em all in convulsions and emotions
I put careers in negotions
And put the body in the ocean
I made an oath when my nigga told me to go in
Then he died on a cold bench
All my old friends livin' life on a slow end
Gotta keep shit rollin', it's deep (it's deep)
I done fucked so much, I can't sleep
I done fucked so much, I'm retired (swear to God)
I'm 'bout to live my life through Dave Free (swear to God)
She said she broke down when Prince died (it's alright)
Bitch, my hair down, Prince live through me (I am Prince)
Get your ass up and be inspired (get inspired)
You know how many bodies in the street? (how many?)
Take the mask off so you can see

[Chorus: Future]
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Don't chase no bitches

[Outro: Future]
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Gas gone, never nod off
Vengeance is mine, said the Lord

I make the moves up as I go (Moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, mm, mm
That s what they don t know, mm, mm

And the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
You could've been getting down
To this sick beat

[Bridge]
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like,  Oh my God,  but I'm just gonna shake

Yeah, yeah, yeah
M-M-M-Murda
Yeah, yeah
Damn right, bro

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
4 AM, I'm just gettin' started
For my birthday I threw me a surprise party
Reminiscin' 'bout the trap, playin' the first Carter
My life changed when I had my first daughter
Got my first quarter flippin' 50 dollar slabs
Your nigga's lookin' at the bills, askin' you for half
Cut from a different cloth, take pride in results
Anytime she wanna dip I'm providin' the sauce
You on side of the boss, so you kind of the boss
You keep playin' with me, I end up signing your boss
Drop an EP on a nigga for the free-free on a nigga
Yeah you ZZ on a nigga, king like BB on you niggas
Rock with Champagne P
If it wasn't for the struggle then I wouldn't be me
Call me Deuce or Dos, anything but broke
Got my aim from the scope, got the game by the throat, damn!

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Okay, you popped up on me by surprise (Yeah, yeah)
You see I never took you for the poppin' type (Straight up)
Damn, it's 4 AM so please believe the hype (It's lit)
Hit the lights (Yeah), I'm way over top
Pop it, flick it
Drop a pin, send a location (Skrrt, skrrt)
I'ma pull up in that bullet-coupe spaceship (Skrrt, skrrt)
Drop off a bag of some dangerous (Yeah)
I'ma hit you, 4 AM, see if you make it (Yeah)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I dropped ColleGrove out the sky, ooh
In a group with the best rapper that's alive, ooh
Never turn my back on my slime, ooh
I ain't wanna fuck the bitch but she was fine, ooh
Hold up baby, let me take my time, ooh
Hard to get some head and try to drive, ooh
Jumpin' out the cake and that's surprisin', ooh
Pickin' up the duffel bag like exercisin', ooh
Bought mama new house 'cause she deserve it, ooh
Practice makes perfect but nobody's perfect, ooh
Escobar is not open for service, ooh
Send you to Dr. Miami for your surgery, ooh

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Okay, you popped up on me by surprise (Yeah, yeah)
You see I never took you for the poppin' type (Straight up)
Damn, it's 4 AM so please believe the hype (It's lit)
Hit the lights (Yeah), I'm way over top
Pop it, flick it
Drop a pin, send a location (Skrrt, skrrt)
I'ma pull up in that bullet-coupe spaceship (Skrrt, skrrt)
Drop off a bag of some dangerous (Yeah)
I'ma hit you, 4 AM, see if you make it (Yeah)

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz & Travis Scott]
Ooh, Riccardo Tisci on the crewneck
Ooh, on a killin' rapper spree and nigga, you next
Ooh, they talkin', chillin', watchin' Netflix (Straight up)
Ooh, I used to trap and watch bootlegs
Ooh, I'm on my wave like a durag
Ooh, I see your boo, now where your crew at?
Ooh, talkin' tequila for the pipe-up
Ooh, I hope you got a clean vagina, yeah
Drench god, drench god, really
Representin', we the squad, really (Oh, yeah)
Tec got the Rollie, now I get it
I used to sell drugs for a living
Got me a job sellin' records
Had to use my jeweler for a reference
Might buy a charm with the extras
Might use her legs for a necklace

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Okay, you popped up on me by surprise (Yeah, yeah)
You see I never took you for the poppin' type (Straight up)
Damn, it's 4 AM so please believe the hype (It's lit)
Hit the lights (Yeah), I'm way over top

[Outro]
Don't stop trappin', boy
Got 'bout 12 racks this mornin'
Got 'bout 12 racks
Started last night, still goin'
12 racks strong
Got the pitbull in the corner, she pregnant
Got the crackhead in the corner, she pregnant
Everybody in here pregnant, 'cept my partner and them
But we gettin' this money though, I'm tellin' you that

Blank Space by Taylor Swift

[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
"Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"
Ayy

[Verse 2]
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Verse 3]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no

[Verse 4]
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessin' like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Bridge]
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby

Bad Blood by Taylor Swift

[Chorus]
 Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
 Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1]
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
 Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
 Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 2]
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So don't think it's in the past
These kinds of wounds they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you're coming my way
Just don't

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
 Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
 Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Bridge]
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold!

[Chorus]
 Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
 Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

And I don't think we can solve 'em (Think we can solve 'em)
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

 Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done (Look what you've done)

Wildest Dreams by Taylor Swift

[Verse 1]
He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of this city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa

[Verse 2]
I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request, it is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah haa (ah-aah haa)
Wildest dreams, ah-aah haa

[Bridge]
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday when you leave me, I'd bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burning (burning) it (it) down (down)
Someday when you leave me, I'll bet these memories
Follow (follow) you (you) around (around)
(Follow you around)

[Breakdown]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your (pretend, just pretend)
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, ha (ah-aah-aah-aah-aah-ha)
In your wildest dreams, ah-aah, ha
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, ha
In your wildest dreams, ah-aah, ha

Feels (feat. Pharrell Williams, Katy Perry & Big Sean) by Calvin Harris

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Hey!
Well nothing ever last forever, no
One minute you're here and the next you're gone
So I respect you, wanna take it slow
I need a mental receipt to know this moment I owe

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Do you mind if I steal a kiss? (Chop, chop)
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you?
To memorize the way you shock me
The way you move it here (Hey)
Just wanna feel it from you (Hey)

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Don't be afraid to catch feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Hey)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (Hey)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Feels with me

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
I'm your window shopper, sucker for your love, oh
I'm wearing your goggles, virtual reality
It ain't what it cost you, it might be a dollar
As long as it shocks you, memory, electricity

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Do you mind if I steal a kiss? (Chop, chop)
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you? (Oh, yeah)
To memorize the way you shock me (Zap)
The way you move it here (Hey)
Just wanna feel it from you (Hey)

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
Don't be afraid to catch feels (Ha)
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Oh-oh-oh, oh)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (Hey)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels (Straight up)
Feels with me (Woah)

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Goddamn, I know you love to make an entrance
Do you like getting paid or getting paid attention?
You mixed the wrong guys with the right intentions
In the same bed, but it still feel long distance
She's looking for a little more consistency
But when you stop looking you gon' find what's meant to be
And honestly, I'm way too done with the hoes
I cut off all my exes for your x and o's
I feel my old flings was just preparing me
When I say I want you, say it back, parakeet
Fly in first-class through the air, Airbnb
I'm the best you had, you just be comparing me to me
I'ma 'at' this at you, if I put you on my phone
And upload it, it'll get maximum views
I came through in the clutch with the lipsticks and phones
Wear your fave cologne just to get you alone

[Chorus: Katy Perry & Big Sean]
Don't be afraid to catch feels
Don't be afraid to catch these feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Yeah)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (I know)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Woah, woah, woah
Feels with me
Don't be afraid to catch feels (No, no)
Don't be afraid, baby
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Woah, okay)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills
I know, I know, I know, I know
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Feels with me

Perfect Places by Lorde

[Verse 1]
Every night, I live and die
Feel the party to my bones
Watch the wasters blow the speakers
Spill my guts beneath the outdoor light
It's just another graceless night
I hate the headlines and the weather
I'm 19 and I'm on fire
But when we're dancing I'm alright
It's just another graceless night

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you lost enough?
Have another drink, get lost in us
This is how we get notorious, oh
'Cause I don't know
If they keep tellin' me where to go
I'll blow my brains out to the radio, oh

[Chorus]
All of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places

[Verse 2]
Every night, I live and die
Meet somebody, take 'em home
Let's kiss and then take off our clothes
It's just another graceless night

[Chorus]
All of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places

[Outro]
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?

Sober by Lorde

[Intro]
Night, midnight, lose my mind
Night, midnight, lose my mind
Night, midnight, lose my mind
(When you get to my high, when you get to my)
Night, midnight

[Verse 1]
Oh, God, I'm clean out of air in my lungs
It's all gone
Played it so nonchalant
It's time we danced with the truth
Move alone with the truth
Ooh (hey)
We're sleeping through all the days
I'm acting like I don't see
Every ribbon you used to tie yourself to me

[Pre-Chorus]
But my hips have missed your hips
So, let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me?
Go astray with me?
(Ah ha)

[Chorus]
We're King and Queen of the weekend
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
When you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
These are the games of the weekend
We pretend that we just don't care
But we care
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
When you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)

[Verse 2]
Oh, God, I'm closing my teeth
Around this liquor-wet lime
Midnight, lose my mind
I know you're feeling it too
Can we keep up with the ruse?
Ah ah (hey)
B-bodies all through my house
I know this story by heart:
Jack and Jill get fucked up and possessive
When it get dark

[Pre-Chorus]
But my hips have missed your hips
So, let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me?
Go astray with me?
(Ah ha)

[Chorus]
We're King and Queen of the Weekend
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
When you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
These are the games of the weekend
We pretend that we just don't care
But we care
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
When you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)

[Bridge]
Midnight, we're fading
'Til daylight, we're jaded
We know that it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with all the heartache
And the treason, the fantasies of leaving
But we know that, when it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with us
(Midnight, lose my mind, midnight, lose my mind)
Oh, dancing with us
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Oh, you'll be dancing with us
(Can you feel it? Can you feel it?)
Dancing with us, us
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Us

[Outro]
When you get to my high (midnight, lose my mind)
When you get to my (midnight, lose my mind)

Supercut by Lorde

[Verse 1]
In my head, I play a supercut of us
All the magic we gave off
All the love we had and lost
And in my head
The visions never stop
These ribbons wrap me up
But when I reach for you
There's just a supercut

[Pre-Chorus]
In your car, the radio up
In your car, the radio up
We keep trying to talk about us
I'm someone you maybe might love
I ll be your quiet afternoon crush
Be your violent overnight rush
Make you crazy over my touch

[Chorus]
But it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
Oh it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us

[Verse 2]
So I fall
Into continents and cars
All the stages and the stars
I turn all of it
To just a supercut

[Refrain]
'Cause in my head (in my head, I do everything right)
When you call (when you call, I'll forgive and not fight)
Because ours are the moments I play in the dark
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
In your car, the radio up
In your car, the radio up
We keep trying to talk about us
Slow motion, I'm watching our love
I ll be your quiet afternoon crush
Be your violent overnight rush
Make you crazy over my touch

[Chorus]
But it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
Oh it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
But it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
Oh it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us

[Refrain]
In my head, I do everything right
When you call, I'll forgive and not fight
Are the moments I play in the dark
And fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh
'Cause in my head (in my head, I do everything right)
When you call (when you call, I'll forgive and not fight)
Because ours are the moments I play in the dark
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh
'Cause in my head (in my head, I do everything right)
When you call (when you call, I'll forgive and not fight)
Because ours are the moments I play in the dark
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh
In my head, I do everything right
In my head, I do everything right

The Louvre by Lorde

[Verse 1]
Well, summer slipped us underneath her tongue
Our days and nights are perfumed with obsession
Half of my wardrobe is on your bedroom floor
Use our eyes, throw our hands overboard

[Verse 2]
I am your sweetheart psychopathic crush
Drink up your movements, still I can't get enough
I overthink your punctuation use
Not my fault, just a thing that my mind do

[Pre-Chorus]
A rush at the beginning
I get caught up, just for a minute
But lover, you're the one to blame
All that you re doing
Can you hear the violence?
Megaphone to my chest
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

[Chorus]
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

[Verse 3]
Our thing progresses
I call and you come through
Blow all my friendships
To sit in hell with you
But we re the greatest
They ll hang us in the Louvre
Down the back, but who cares still the Louvre
Okay I know that you are not my type
(still I fall)
I m just the sucker who let you fill her mind
(but what about love?)
Nothing wrong with it
Supernatural
Just move in close to me, closer, you ll feel it coasting

[Pre-Chorus]
A rush at the beginning
I get caught up, just for a minute
But lover, you're the one to blame
All that you re doing
Can you hear the violence?
Megaphone to my chest
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

[Chorus]
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

Walking The Wire by Imagine Dragons

[Verse 1]
Do you feel the same when I'm away from you?
Do you know the line that I'd walk for you?
We could turn around and we could give it up
But we'll take what comes, take what comes
Oh, the storm is raging against us now
If you're afraid of falling, then don't look down
But we took the step, oh, we took the leap
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here

[Chorus]
We're walking the wire, love
We're walking the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up
We're walking the wire, wire, wire

[Verse 2]
There's nights we had to just walk away
And there's tears we'll cry, but those tears will fade
It's a price you pay when it comes to love
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

[Pre-Chorus]
Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here

[Chorus]
We're walking the wire, love
We're walking the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up
We're walking the wire, wire, wire

[Bridge]
So look out down below
Look out down below
Look out down below
Walking the wire, wire, wire
So look out down below

[Verse 3]
Oh, I'll take your hand when thunder roars
And I'll hold you close, I'll stay the course
I promise you from up above
That we'll take what comes, take what comes, love

[Chorus]
We're walking the wire, love
We're walking the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up
We're walking the wire, wire, wire

[Outro]
So look out down below
Look out down below
Look out down below
Walking the wire, wire, wire
So look out down below

Hard Feelings/Loveless by Lorde

Hard Feelings

(Go back and tell it)

Please could you be tender
And I will sit close to you
Let s give it a minute before we admit that we re through
Guess this is the winter
Our bodies are young and blue
I m at Jungle City, it s late and this song is for you

Cause I remember the rush, when forever was us
Before all of the winds of regret and mistrust
Now we sit in your car and our love is a ghost
Well I guess I should go
Yeah I guess I should go

Hard feelings 
These are what they call hard feelings of love
When the sweet words and fevers all leave us right here in the cold
Alone with the hard feelings of love
God I wish I believed ya when you told me this was my home

I light all the candles
Cut flowers for all my rooms
I care for myself the way I used to care about you
These days, we kiss and we keep busy
The waves come after midnight
I call from underwater
Why even try to get right?
When you ve outgrown a lover
The whole world knows but you
It s time to let go of this endless summer afternoon

Hard feelings 
These are what they call hard feelings of love
When the sweet words and fevers all leave us right here in the cold
Alone with the hard feelings of love
God I wish I believed ya when you told me this was my home

Three years, loved you every single day, made me weak, it was real for me, yup, real for me
Now I'll fake it every single day 'til I don t need fantasy, 'til I feel you leave
But I still remember everything, how we d drift buying groceries, how you d dance for me
I ll start letting go of little things 'til I m so far away from you, far away from you, yeah
Loveless

 What is this tape? 
 This is my favorite tape 
Bet you wanna rip my heart out
Bet you wanna skip my calls now

Writer In The Dark by Lorde

[Verse 1]
Break the news you're walking out
To be a good man for someone else
Sorry I was never good like you
Stood on my chest and kept me down
Hated hearing my name on the lips of a crowd
Did my best to exist just for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark

[Chorus]
I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe

[Verse 2]
I still feel you, now and then
Slow like pseudo-ephedrine
When you see me, will you say I've changed?
I ride the subway, read the signs
I let the seasons change my mind
I love it here since I ve stopped needing you

[Pre-Chorus]
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark

[Chorus]
I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe
I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe

Sober II (Melodrama) by Lorde

You asked if I was feeling it, I m psycho high
Know you won t remember in the morning when
I speak my mind
Lights are on and they ve gone home, but who am I?
Oh, how fast the evening passes, cleaning up
The champagne glasses

We told you this was melodrama
(Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses)
Our only wish is melodrama
(Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses)

And the terror
And the horror
When we wonder why we bother
And the terror and the horror
God, I wonder why we bother
All the glamour and the trauma and the fuckin'
Melodrama

All the gun fights
And the lime lights
And the holy sick divine nights
They ll talk about us, all the lovers
How we kiss and kill each other
They ll talk about us, and discover
How we kissed and killed each other

We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offer

[Chorus: Quavo]
Good drank, big knots
Good drugs, I put a four on the rocks (lean!)

Three mil in a month
But I just did three years on a bunk
Oh, you in a slump
I'm headed to Oakland like  Kevin Da Runt
What is your point?
Square with the stamp, for Kevin Durant
Lay on on my trap
Play with my cap and I'll knock off your hat
I'm taking the cheese and killing the rats
Gucci Mane, call me the cat with the racks
I'm swervin', but I'm in back of the 'Bach

He nervous, ain t got no words for that
He hurt and want all of his purses back

Trapper of the year, I'm from Bouldercrest
You snitch of the year cause you told the bis'

Good drank, big knots

I Don t Know Why by Imagine Dragons

[Verse 1]
We could be strangers in the night
We could be passing in the shadows
We couldn't be closer if we tried
When we're caught in the headlights
We could be faces in the crowd
We could be passing in the shadows
Loving the risk of being found
When we're caught in the headlights

[Pre-Chorus]
Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost in us
We're living in a lie of trust

[Chorus]
I don't know why
But I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you

[Verse 2]
I was a vacant alibi
Trading the truth in for a lie, oh
We were the essence of desire
And we're caught in the headlights

[Pre-Chorus]
Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost in us
We're living in a lie of trust

[Chorus]
I don't know why
But I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you

[Bridge]
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Dangerous
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Your love is always dangerous
Tell me that you love me

[Chorus]
I don't know why
I don't know why
But I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you

I ll Make It Up To You by Imagine Dragons

[Verse 1]
Took your heart, took your hand
Promise you all that I had
Hoping that you understand
Far from a perfect man

[Refrain]
'Cause honey it's been a hard year
It seems like we're going nowhere
Crying inside your bedroom
Baby, I know it's not fair

[Interlude]
Lay with me for one more night
I promise you, I'll make it right

[Chorus]
I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you

[Verse 2]
I know you don't understand
The vices that follow a man
And in your eyes I can see
The places that you'd rather be

[Refrain]
'Cause honey it's been a hard year
It seems like we're going nowhere
You're crying inside your bedroom
Baby, I know it's not fair

[Chorus]
I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you

[Bridge]
In our darkest hour
In the dead of the night
I'll make it up to you
Your hands are mine
I'll make it up to you
Promises are nothing more
Than fleeting thoughts
But you, you are my lifeblood

[Chorus]
I'll make it up to you
Every night, I'll make it up to you
Every night, I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you

Rise Up by Imagine Dragons

[Verse 1]
I was hoping for an indication
I was seeking higher elevation
(Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye)
I've been shaken, waking in the night light
I've been breaking, hiding from the spotlight
(Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye)

[Pre-Chorus]
The more I stray, the less I fear
And the more I reach, the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh, it's calling out, and I won't walk away

[Chorus]
I would always open up the door
Always looking up for higher floors
Wanna see it all give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for making changes
Walking down the street meeting strangers
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up)

[Verse 2]
Like a prayer that only needs a reason
Like a hunter waiting for the season
(Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye)
I was there, but I was always leaving
I've been living, but I was never breathing
(Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye)

[Pre-Chorus]
The more I stray, the less I fear
And the more I reach, the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh, it's calling out, and I won't walk away

[Chorus]
I would always open up the door
Always looking up for higher floors
Wanna see it all give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for making changes
Walking down the street meeting strangers
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up)

[Bridge]
I'm bursting like the Fourth of July
So color me and blow me away
I'm broken in the prime of my life
So embrace it and leave me to stray

[Chorus]
I would always open up the door
Always looking up for higher floors
Wanna see it all give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for making changes
Walking down the street meeting strangers
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up)
I would always open up the door
Always looking up for higher floors
Want to see it all give me more (rise, rise up)
I was always up for making changes
Walking down the street meeting strangers
Flipping through my life turning pages (rise, rise up)

[Outro]
(Rise, rise up)
(Rise, rise up)

Perfect Places by Lorde

[Verse 1]
Every night, I live and die
Feel the party to my bones
Watch the wasters blow the speakers
Spill my guts beneath the outdoor light
It's just another graceless night
I hate the headlines and the weather
I'm 19 and I'm on fire
But when we're dancing I'm alright
It's just another graceless night

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you lost enough?
Have another drink, get lost in us
This is how we get notorious, oh
'Cause I don't know
If they keep tellin' me where to go
I'll blow my brains out to the radio, oh

[Chorus]
All of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places

[Verse 2]
Every night, I live and die
Meet somebody, take 'em home
Let's kiss and then take off our clothes
It's just another graceless night

[Chorus]
All of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places

[Outro]
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places anyway?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Do, re, mi, fa, so
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah, if I could go back to that day we met
I probably would just stay in bed
You run your mouth all over town
And this one goes out to the sound
Of breaking glass on my Range Rover
Pay me back or bitch, it's over
All the presents I would send
Fuck my friends behind my shoulder
Next time I'ma stay asleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And you got me thinking lately
Bitch, you crazy
And nothing's ever good enough
I wrote a little song for ya
It go like

So fuckin' done with all the games you play

I'm do, re, mi, fa, so fuckin' done with you, girl
So send the X and O's on another note, I'm ghost
(Ghost, ghost, ghost)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh)

[Verse 2]
If I could go back to the day we met
I probably would've stayed in bed
You wake up every day
And make me feel like I'm incompetent
Designer shoes and Xanax tabs
Compliments your make-up bag
You never had to buy yourself a drink
'Cause everybody want to tap that ass sometime

[Pre-Chorus]
And you got me thinking lately
Bitch, you crazy
And nothing's ever good enough
I wrote a little song for ya
It go like

[Chorus]
Do, re, mi, fa, so fuckin' done with you, girl

Start Over by Imagine Dragons

[Verse 1]
Clenched teeth, no words
All this distance taking its toll
Speaking volumes
Silence screaming over your words

[Pre-Chorus]
I never did you right, I know that
Too many sleepless nights, I own that
I said it time and time, I know that
I wanna try again

[Chorus]
Can we start over?
Can we start over?
Can we start over
Before it's over, over?

[Verse 2]
Cold nights, cold sheets
One more lonely empty hotel room
What I'd give to
Find my way back into you

[Pre-Chorus]
I never did you right, and I know that
Too many sleepless nights, I own that
I said it time and time, I know that
I wanna try again

[Chorus]
Can we start over?
Can we start over?
Can we start over
Before it's over, over?
Can we start over?
Can we get closer?
Can we start over
Before it's over, over?

[Bridge]
Come alive, come alive, come alive again
Come alive, come alive, come alive again
Come alive, come alive, come alive again
Come alive, come alive, come alive again

[Chorus]
Can we start, can we start over?
Can we start over?
Can we start over
Before it's over, over?
Can we start over?
(Come alive, come alive, come alive again)
Can we get closer?

Faking It by Calvin Harris

[Verse 1: Kehlani]
Pray to God, but I'm feeling like he's going deaf
Now when I lean on you and I got nothing left
Hey, I've been wanting to call ya, tell you that I'm sorry
Same old fucking story everybody sing

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you crying

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
Nowadays, I'm just a bitch to everybody else
(Fuck you and you)
I don't need no shoulders, I'm good crying by myself
(Fuck you, too)
Moving on's a chore, 'cause you know I still adore ya
An unrequited love is just a lover's hell

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
And I say I'm okay, but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay, but I saw that you liked it
2 AM and faded, I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me, know that's when you crying

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
(Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat, Lil Boat)
I'm not gonna act like I don't love ya baby
'Cause deep in my mind, girl, I know I do (true)
Tried to search all through the world and not well
But I can't find a girl who looks close like you (no!)
I done made millions of dollars
But I'm still alone until I come home back to you (yah!)
I remember all of the times we were parked by your house
And laughed all on your avenue
Whoa, you can't front, you're a stone cold diva (yaah!)
I had to get counseling from my moms
She's a heartbreak teacher (oh, yah!)
Remember that time I put those pepperonis on your face
Made you a creature
Now I think about you every single time I eat pizza, ohh

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Why you, why you, why you checking if you're over it?
Why you, why you say "Let go" if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

[Post-Chorus: Kehlani]
Why you holding me?
Why you holding me?

[Outro: Lil Yachty]
Oh, she killed that shit
She was killing it, that was hard, bruh
I didn't know she could get that high but she killed that
Go Lani, go Lani

[Verse 3]
Ay yo, bring in the blunt, Emily Blunt
Platinum back, ice bling in the front
I'ma land the jump, Yao Ming in the dunk
And I'm playing the field, Brad Wingin the punt
I'ma tell him I love him in the foreign and cuff him
Whips in immigration, everything on them is custom
Now they calling me Billy, I'm the goat
No Achilles heel since I left Philly
Countin' them millis to billis
Beep beep beep beep, put the hurt on me
Yeah, I'm wearing jeans, but he put the skrt on me
Rode him to sleep, and then I put his shirt on me
Pussy clean, these niggas ain't got no dirt on me
Gotta play it by my rules or I swerve on him
Bout my cash money, you can ask Bird or Slim
Took him to my paradise, silk ribbon my linen
Now he got a big thing for Caribbean women

[Chorus]
Beep beep, babe, I need you to skrt on me, babe
Drop down low; Said you know I need to know
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe

'Cause the hips don't lie, baby
Drop down low; Said you know I need to know
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe
Beep beep, babe, I need you to skrt on me, babe
Drop down low; Said you know I need to know
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe
But if you with it, wine up on me
'Cause the hips don't lie, baby
Drop down low; Said you know I need to know
'Cause you keep telling me your love ain't free, babe

911 (Call me)

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My thirst levels are infinity and beyond
Sippin' on that lemonade, I need a Beyoncé
Can't see straight, these shades are Céline Dion
Sucks you can't gas me up, shout out to Elon
Musk, yeah, I got a sold out show
Crowd wild out but don't matter 'cause you not front row
I've been lookin' for a keeper, listen to the speaker
If you fit description, hit me on my beeper
At that 911

[Bridge: Steve Lacy, Anna of the North & Tyler, The Creator]
Call me some time (ring, ring, ring)
Please bang my line, you know I'll answer (click)

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Chirp, chirp
Chirp, chirp
Woke up in the 'burbs, 'burbs, with the birds, birds
Where you used to come and get me with the swerve, swerve
These days you gotta find time
Even the night line
Work line
Dial nine

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Five car garage
Full tank of the gas
But that don't mean nothing, nothing
Nothin', nothin', without you shotgun in the passenger
I'm the loneliest man alive
But I keep on dancing to throw 'em off
I'm gon' run out of moves 'cause I can't groove to the blues
If you know any DJs, tell 'em to call me at 911...

[Part II: Mr. Lonely]

[Intro: A$AP Rocky, ScHoolboy Q, Lionel & Tyler, The Creator]
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old lonely ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Forreal, you need to go somewhere, like, get some bitches or something
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old weird ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely

[Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
They say the loudest in the room is weak
That's what they assume, but I disagree
I say the loudest in the room
Is prolly the loneliest one in the room (that's me)
Attention seeker, public speaker
Oh my God, that boy there is so fuckin' lonely
Writin' songs about these people
Who do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony
One thing I know, is that I wanna
Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago
Heart is low, it's real low, it's so low
You can't lift me up, I'm like Gallardo
From the start it's been real dark
It's been so dark, I guess that you could call me charbroiled, huh
I'm playin' like Hasbro
I'm really Saari, call me Arto
Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla
I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (skrrt)
But what the fuck else do you want from me?
That is the only thing keepin' me company
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed
These items is fillin' the void
Been fillin' it for so long
I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (ohh)
Current battle as an adult
My partner is a shadow
I need love, do you got some I could borrow?
Fuck it, I could find some tomorrow
But that never comes
Like a vasectomy, what have I done?
I got the talent, the face and the funds
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (who)
Mirror, mirror on the wall (who)
The loneliest of them all (me)
Cupid actin' stupid
Do you got another number I could call?
Never had a pet
I've never had a pet
There's more fish in the sea
But I never had a goldfish to begin with
I never had a dog
So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch
I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet
Treat me like direct deposit
Check in on me sometime
Ask me how I'm really doin'
So I never have to press that 911

[Outro: Jasper]
Ohh! Damn! Damn!

Who Dat Boy by Tyler, The Creator

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Yo, who dat boy? Who him is?
Him that ni-guh, I swear
Stand out guy, him don't need no chair
Well, where the fuck him at? 'Cause nigga, I'm right here
I don't shop at the mall, all y'all just
Dumb mothafucka, I'm a goddamn artist
You can give me some markers and I'll draw you a closet
And you know that it's GOLF, bitch, gonna make the deposit
Nigga fresh to death like he got dressed in a coffin
Cons, overalls, and a striped shirt
The boy drips swag like a broken faucet
It's runnin', nigga, I'm runnin' shit
That cherry be the bomb like he ran in Boston
Won't stop 'til the cops surround him
One nigga jiggy and the other awesome
With his fuckin' face blown off, that's how they found him
It's Young T

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & A$AP Rocky]
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Nigga, who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dem boys? Nigga, who dem is, nigga?
Why you niggas feel like that?
Mad 'cause a nigga neck chill like that
You mad 'cause a nigga push wheel like that?
Why you puttin' bad vibes in the air like that?
Nigga, who dem boys?

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Who dem is? Nigga, who dem is?
Who else step in this bitch this jig?
Who else your bitch say got a bick this big?
Who else came through with a wrist this flick?
Nigga, Guess my pants, do my dance
Spin around, bitch, you could kiss my ass
Never seen a nigga in this much Raf
Still doin' math when I miss my class
Was it Summertime '06, had the Number (N)ine
Nigga, never mind, was another time before Vince
Had the Gucci gold tips with the letterman
Nigga, dollar sign was my favorite number at the time
Fresh freshmen 'til they skipped my ass
Senior citizen, don't forget my pass
Been that nigga and you knew that there
Make the dick disappear, how she do that there?

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & A$AP Rocky]
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Nigga, who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dem boys? Nigga, who dem is, nigga?
Why you niggas feel like that?
Mad 'cause a nigga's neck chill like that
You mad 'cause a nigga push wheel like that?
Why you puttin' bad vibes in the-?

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & A$AP Rocky]
Fuck the rap, I'm tryna own a planet
From my other fuckin' business ventures
These niggas these days
Actin' like some bitches, like they're fuckin' with ya (yeah)
Teeth is glistenin', Jesus, Christmas
He just shittin', she exquisite, bitches be expensive
(Yeah, let 'em know, nigga) And I don't even need attention
WANG$AP on the bumper sticker, fuck you niggas
Fuck global warming, my neck is so
I'm currently lookin' for '95 Leo
My mom say she worried because I'm so ill
I should stay in bed, but got too much bread
To make, she said watch my weight
So I stayed home and start eatin' some meals
Get out of my way, guey, boy that's McLaren
That's 0 to 60 in 2 point nueve, I'm gone

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
Fuck

Uh Huh by Julia Michaels

[Verse 1]
It's electric how my lipstick
Makes its own way right into your kiss, and
It's pathetic how we both get
Kinda fucked up, hanging on each other
We're ahead now, should we slow down?
Should we slow down now?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm getting some kind of shake without you

[Chorus]
Uh-huh! I think you're movin' in too close
But I think that it's my body wanting it the most, like
Uh-huh! I don't know what it is I feel
But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill, like

[Hook]
Uh-huh! (Uh-huh!) Uh-huh! (Uh-huh!)
But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill

[Verse 2]
It's electric how symmetric
We both get when you lay beside me
It's phonetic how our mouths grip
Almost too tight to the words we're sayin'
We're in deep now, should we slow down?
Should we slow down now?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm getting some kind of shake without you

[Chorus]
Uh-huh! I think you're movin' in too close
But I think that it's my body wanting it the most, like
Uh-huh! I don't know what it is I feel
But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill, like

[Hook]
Uh-huh! (Uh-huh!) Uh-huh! (Uh-huh!)
But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill, like
Uh-huh! (Uh-huh!) Uh-huh! (Uh-huh!)
But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill

[Post-Chorus]
Goin' in for the kill
Goin' in for the kill

[Bridge]
It's rare when the panic in my mind
Feels so damn good
Woo!

[Chorus]
Uh-huh! I think you're movin' in too close
But I think that it's my body wanting it the most, like
Uh-huh! I don't know what it is I feel
But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill, like

[Hook]
Uh-huh! (Uh-huh!) Uh-huh! (Uh-huh!)
But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill, like
Uh-huh! (Uh-huh!) Uh-huh! (Uh-huh!)
But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill

Famous by 21 Savage

[Verse 1]
Rags to riches, nigga came from the bottom
Hood rats, now a nigga fuckin' on models
Ridin' in the foreign, remember ridin' on MARTA
Grind got harder and my mind got smarter
I was gettin' bags for the cheap
When I ain't had money, I was robbin', nigga
I was gettin' bags for the free
21 Gang, they were right beside me
And they still with me, nigga, I'm on TV
Couple niggas switched up, bitched up, fuck 'em
I can't go nowhere without a pistol or a rubber
I'm too, too player to put a bitch before my brother
I'm too street smart, nigga, to serve a undercover
Niggas tryna clone a nigga's shit, damn, woah
Used to drive a hotbox, shit, Lambo
Niggas want a handout, shit, mine broke
I grinded for this shit, I grinded for this shit
Can't change on my gang, niggas still here
Kinda hard to change my ways 'cause the shit real
Niggas rappin' 'bout shit they ain't even lived
Niggas lyin', I can hear it in their ad-libs
I'm poppin' Percocets, bitch, not Advil
It's kinda fucked up what they did to Black, damn
If I catch him in the trap, I'ma whack him
I catch that boy in traffic, nigga, I'ma whack him
Nigga, try to keep up with this fashion
Makin' sure my kids happy
They dependent on their daddy
Tryin' not to let the streets distract me
I know it's bumps in the road like acne
Had to sell dope, I couldn't be an athlete
I'm a solid young nigga, you can ask C
The internet ain't gon' help you understand me

[Chorus]
I'm a street nigga, yeah I'm famous
I'm a rapper, nigga, and I'm gangbangin'
Everybody kill a nigga, what you claimin'?
Everybody get it with your nigga flamin'
All these chains on a nigga like I'm stranglin'
Ran off with your money, nigga, guess we straight then
You knockoff gangbangers ain't bangin'
In the hood everyday, I'm hangin'

[Verse 2]
And I come through when the gang need
And I wear shades so they can't see
And I pay them lawyers and the bond fees
Nigga one thousand, I'm beyond G
I put my main bitch inside Givenchy
Niggas still askin', "Can you front me?"
My old ho sayin', "Boy you growed up"
Promethazine, it got a nigga slowed up
Too solid, pussy niggas can't disclose us
Went and seen Eliantte, and he froze us
I'm too street to walk around with my nose up
Especially to the niggas knew me 'fore I blowed up
Savage Mode drop, now my price'll go up
Streets cold, nigga, they ain't showin' no love
Niggas get in front of judge and they fold up
Face shot, hit that boy with the whole dub

[Chorus]
I'm a street nigga, yeah I'm famous
I'm a rapper, nigga, and I'm gangbangin'
Everybody kill a nigga, what you claimin'?
Everybody get it with your nigga flamin'
All these chains on a nigga like I'm stranglin'
Ran off with your money, nigga, guess we straight then
You knockoff gangbangers ain't bangin'
In the hood everyday, I'm hangin'

[Outro]
Couple niggas switched up, bitched up, fuck 'em
I can't go nowhere without a pistol or a rubber
I'm too, too player to put a bitch before my brother
I'm too street smart, nigga, to serve a undercover

Shawty in the way, got the mothafuckin' fix, yeah
Sippin' all day got me leanin' off the kickstand
House on my neck, 'nother house on my wristband
Girls really love me like a mothafuckin' six pack
No time for restin' (restin')
My life's invested in bein' a fuckin' legend (legend)
An icon, tryna cement it ('ment it)
I'm treatin' every year like it's game 7 (game 7)
I feel like problems in my city been deaded (deaded)
I feel like me and my niggas are unthreatened (threatened)
My new girl hate it when I'm always spendin' (all the time)
I guess I gotta get used to it 'cause of my exes
But it's true, though (but it's true, though)
But it's true, though (but it's true, though)

If I ain't the hottest in the city, that's a lie (that's a lie)
School, teach you how to read the lines (read the lines)
In these streets, gotta read between the lines
Room, room full of ether clouds, you don't want no smoke
'Fore, before I choke, baby, I'ma choke 'em from their choker (yeah)
Only the red in my eyes see where you come from
We, we the gang, either you run with or run from

I got it a little cheap, baby you should come and play
Daddy will pay the cab, maybe stay for a day
No one got it but me
Bitches, they call me whore, son, more buns
Mami bent over for hum
Give her, what she want and let her get it good
Put it on her tongue
Told me, "Charly, boy you gotta give
Fix me with a lot of dick
Hit me with a lot of kick
Show me you the man"
Bustin' quickies and dippin'
That be somethin' I can't stand
Other plans, baby, had of late
Tried to put me in a twirl like the Cheerio

Put me in a video, I can make a wave
Baby girl, comin' home and you can't stay, oww

Miracles (Someone Special) by Coldplay

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
My father said never give up son
Just look how good Cassius become
Muhammad, Mahatma, and Nelson
Not scared to be strong

[Spoken]
 What if they say I m no good? What if they say "Get out of here, kid. You got no future? 

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
Now you could run and just say they re right
No, I ll never be no one in my whole life
Or you could turn and say, "No, wait, they're wrong"
And get to keep on dancing all life long

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
My father said never give up son
Just look what Amelia and Joan done
Oh Rosa, Teresa their war won
Not scared to be strong

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
Now you could run and just say they re right
No I ll never be no one in my whole life
Or you could turn and say no wait, they re wrong
And get to keep on dancing all life long

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Yeah you could be someone special
You've got bright in your brains and lightning in your veins
You'll go higher than they've ever gone
In you I see someone special
You've got fire in your eyes and when you realize you'll go further than we've ever gone
Just turn it on

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Look I paid my intuition I couldn't afford tuition
My funds was insufficient, it felt like I'm in prison
Until I realized I had to set my mind free
I was trusting statistics more than I trust me
Get a degree, good job, 401k, but I m trying to turn k s to m , what does it take?
And maybe I could be the new Ali of music prolly
Instead of doing it just as a hobby like these boys told me to
I guess you either watch the show or you show and prove
Prove it to them or you prove it to yourself  but honestly it's better if you do it for yourself
Never complacent till we hit the oasis
One life don't waste it feel my heart races, success I taste it, ah
We on the verge of getting every single thing that we deserve

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
Yeah you could be someone special
You've got fire in your eyes I see heaven inside you'll go further than we've ever gone
In you I see someone special
You've got bright in your brains you can break through those chains you'll go higher than we've ever gone
Just turn it on

[Outro: Chris Martin]
In you I see someone special
Don't go to war with yourself
Just turn, just turn, just turn it on and you can't go wrong

One Step Closer by Linkin Park

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you'll say
You'll find that out anyway

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Just like before

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break)

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Just like before

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe

I'm about to break)
Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
('Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to)
Break

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up
Shut up
Shut up
Shut up when I'm talking to you

Shut up
Shut up
Shut up
I'm about to break

Good Goodbye (feat. Pusha T and Stormzy) by Linkin Park

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Live from the rhythm, it's
Something wild, venomous
Enemies trying to read me
You're all looking highly illiterate
Blindly forgetting if I'm in the mix
You won't find an equivalent
I've been here killing it
Longer than you've been alive, you idiot
And it makes you so mad
Somebody else could be stepping in front of you
And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one
There's more than one of you
And you can't understand the fact
That it's over and done, hope you had fun
You've got a lot to discuss on the bus
Headed back where you're from

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
(Wooh!)
Goodbye, good riddance
A period is after every sentence
Did my time with my cellmate
Maxed out so now we finished
Every day was like a hail date
Every night was like a hailstorm
Took her back to my tinted windows
Showin' out, she in rare form
Wings up, now I'm airborne
King Push, they got a chair for him
Make way for the new queen
The old lineup, where they cheer for 'em
Consequence when you ain't there for him
Were you there for him?
Did you care for him?
You were dead wrong

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
(Don't you come back no more)
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)

[Verse 3: Stormzy]
Yo
Let me say goodbye to my demons
Let me say goodbye to my past life
Let me say goodbye to the darkness
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here in the starlight
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here where they love me
Tell 'em that I'm yours this is our life
And I still keep raising the bar like
Never seen a young black brother in the chart twice
Goodbye to the stereotypes
You can't tell my kings we can't
Mandem we're linking tings in parks
Now I got a tune with Linkin Park
Like goodbye to my old hoe s
Goodbye to the cold roads
I can't die for my postcode
Young little Mike from the Gold Coast
And now I'm inside with my bro bro's
Gang

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)

Crawling by Linkin Park

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never ending
Controlling, I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
(There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming) Confusing what is real
(This lack of self-control I fear is never ending
Controlling) Confusing what is real

Battle Symphony by Linkin Park

[Verse 1]
I got a long way to go
And a long memory
I been searching for an answer
Always just out of reach
Blood on the floor
Sirens repeat
I been searching for the courage
To face my enemies
When they turn down the lights

[Chorus]
I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I ll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don t give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

[Bridge]
For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony

[Verse 2]
They say that I don t belong
Say that I should retreat
That I m marching to the rhythm
Of a lonesome defeat
But the sound of your voice
Puts the pain in reverse
No surrender, no illusions
And for better or worse
When they turn down the lights

[Chorus]
I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I ll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don t give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

[Bridge]
If I fall, get knocked down
Pick myself up off the ground
If I fall, get knocked down
Pick myself up off the ground
When they turn down the lights

[Chorus]
I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I ll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don t give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake
For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony

13 Beaches by Lana Del Rey

[Intro]
I don't belong in the world, that's what it is
Something separates me from other people
Everywhere I turn, there's something blocking my escape

[Verse 1]
It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, it's mine
With drippin' peaches, I'm camera ready
Almost all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
But I still get lonely
And baby, only then do I let myself recline
Can I let go, and let your memory dance
In the ballroom of my mind?
Across the county line

[Chorus]
It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin' if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dyin' (Yeah)
For somethin' real
That I've been dyin' for somethin' real

[Verse 2]
It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, I'm fine
Past Ventura and lenses plenty
In the white sunshine

[Pre-Chorus]
But you still can find me, if you ask nicely
Underneath the pines
With the daisies, feelin' hazy
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line

[Chorus]
It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin' if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dyin' (Yeah)
For somethin' real
That I've been dyin' for somethin' real

[Outro]
It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying' if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
The fact that I can't deal

Bleed It Out by Linkin Park

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fucking mind

Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose

Truth is, you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach, somewhere

Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor, again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

[Chorus: Chester Bennington with Mike Shinoda]
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Go, stop the show
Choppy words and a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go

Mama, help me, I've been cursed
Death is rolling in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
Can't contain him, he knows he works

Fuck, this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied

So why try ignoring him?
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I've opened up these scars
I'll make you face this
I've pulled myself so far
I'll make you face this now

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I bleed it out
I bleed it out
I bleed it out

Love by Lana Del Rey

[Verse 1]
Look at you, kids, with your vintage music
Comin' through satellites while cruisin'
You're part of the past, but now you're the future
Signals crossing can get confusin'

[Pre-Chorus]
It's enough just to make you feel crazy, crazy, crazy
Sometimes it's enough just to make you feel crazy

[Chorus]
You get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
Doesn't matter 'cause it's enough
To be young and in love, ah, ah
To be young and in love, ah, ah

[Verse 2]
Look at you, kids, you know you're the coolest
The world is yours and you can't refuse it
Seen so much, you could get the blues, but
That don't mean that you should abuse it

[Pre-Chorus]
Though it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy
I know, it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy

[Chorus]
But you get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
It don't matter because it's enough
To be young and in love, ah, ah
To be young and in love, ah, ah

[Bridge]
Hmm (Ah, ah)
Hmm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby
Hmm (Ah, ah)
Hmm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy
It's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy

[Chorus]
I get ready, I get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
It doesn't matter if I'm not enough
For the future or the things to come
'Cause I'm young and in love, ah, ah
I'm young and in love, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Outro]
Hmm (Ah, ah)
Hmm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby
Hmm (Ah, ah)
Hmm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby

Somewhere I Belong by Linkin Park

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(When this began) I had nothing to say
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused) And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
(Inside of me) But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
(Nothing to lose) Just stuck, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
(Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
And I've got nothing to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
(I was confused) Looking everywhere, only to find
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
(So what am I?) What do I have but negativity?
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me
(Nothing to lose) Nothing to gain, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
(Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel anything else, until my wounds are healed
I will never be anything 'til I break away from me
I will break away, I'll find myself today

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
(Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I wanna heal
I wanna feel like I'm somewhere I belong
I wanna heal
I wanna feel like I'm somewhere I belong
Somewhere I belong

Talking to Myself by Linkin Park

[Verse 1]
Tell me what I've gotta do
There's no getting through to you
The lights are on but nobody's home (nobody's home)
You say I can't understand
But you're not giving me a chance
When you leave me, where do you go? (Where do you go?)

[Pre-Chorus]
All the walls that you keep building
All this time that I spent chasing
All the ways that I keep losing you

[Chorus]
The truth is, you turn into someone else
You keep running like the sky is falling
I can whisper, I can yell
But I know, yeah I know, yeah I know
I'm just talking to myself
Talking to myself
Talking to myself
But I know, yeah I know, yeah I know
I'm just talking to myself

[Verse 2]
I admit I made mistakes
But yours might cost you everything
Can't you hear me calling you home?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, all the walls that you keep building
All this time that I spent chasing
All the ways that I keep losing you

[Chorus]
The truth is, you turned into someone else
You keep running like the sky is falling
I can whisper, I can yell
But I know, yeah I know, yeah I know
I'm just talking to myself
Talking to myself
Talking to myself
Yeah I know, yeah I know, yeah I know
I'm just talking to myself

[Pre-Chorus]
All the walls that you keep building
All this time that I spent chasing
All the ways that I keep losing you

[Chorus/Outro]
The truth is, you turned into someone else
You keep running like the sky is falling
I can whisper, I can yell
But I know, yeah I know, yeah I know
I'm just talking to myself
Talking to myself
Talking to myself
Yeah I know, yeah I know, yeah I know
Talking to myself

Faint by Linkin Park

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I am a little bit of loneliness
A little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars

I am what I want you to want
What I want you to feel
But, it's like no matter what I do
I can't convince you to just believe this is real

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So, I let go, watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But, I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & both]
I can't feel the way I did, before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage, anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I am a little bit insecure
A little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand, I do what I can
But sometimes, I don't make sense

I am what you never wanna say
But, I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
For once, just to hear me out

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So, I let go, watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But, I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & both]
I can't feel the way I did, before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage, anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
No, hear me out, now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now, hear me out, now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & both]
I can't feel the way I did, before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage, anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

[Outro: Chester Bennington & both]
I can't feel
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored

See You Again by Tyler, The Creator

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, oh

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
You live in my dream state
Relocate my fantasy
I stay in reality
You live in my dream state
Anytime I count sheep
That's the only time we make up, make up
You exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids
Now I don't wanna wake up

[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
20/20, 20/20 vision
Cupid hit me, Cupid hit me with precision, I
Wonder if you look both ways
When you cross my mind, I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my day dreams, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes

[Chorus: Kali Uchis & Tyler, The Creator]
Can I get a kiss?
And can you make it last forever?
I said I'm 'bout to go to war
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
Can I get a kiss? (Can I?)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you?)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war (I'm 'bout to)
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
(Uh, switch it up)

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
I said, okay, okay, okay, okie dokie, my infatuation
Is translatin' to another form of what you call it? (Love)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I ain't met you
I've been looking, stop the waiting
'fore I stop the chasing, like an alcoholic
You don't understand me, what the fuck do you mean?
It's them rose tinted cheeks, yeah it's them dirt-colored eyes
Sugar honey iced tea, bumblebee on the scene
Yeah I'd give up my bakery to have a piece of your pie
Yeugh!

[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
20/20, 20/20 vision
Cupid hit me, cupid hit me with precision, I
Wonder if you look both ways
When you cross my mind, I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my day dreams, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes
(So)

[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
Can I get a kiss? (Can I get a kiss?)
And can you make it last forever? (Make it last forever)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to go to war)
I don't know if I'ma see you again (See you again)
Can I get a kiss? (Can I?)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you?)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to)
And I don't know if I'ma see you again

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator & Kali Uchis]
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay, oh
La la, la la la la, la la
La la, la la la, la la
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay, oh
La la, la la la la, la la
La la, la la la la
One more time?

Cherry by Lana Del Rey

[Verse 1]
Love, I said real love is like feelin' no fear
When you're standin' in the face of danger
'Cause you just want it so much
A touch from your real love
Is like heaven takin' the place of somethin' evil
And lettin' it burn off from the rush, yeah, yeah
(Fuck!)

[Chorus]
Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you, I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined

[Verse 2]
Love, is it real love?
It's like smilin' when the firin' squad's against you
And you just stay lined up, yeah
(Fuck!)

[Chorus]
Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you, I fall to pieces (Bitch)
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined (Bitch)

[Bridge]
My rose garden dreams, set on fire by fiends
And all my black beaches are ruined
My celluloid scenes are torn at the seams
And I fall to pieces (Bitch)
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
(Why?)

[Outro]
'Cause I love you so much, I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined (Bitch)
Are ruined (Bitch), are ruined (Fuck!)

Papercut by Linkin Park

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left

I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head

Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall

(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me
Right underneath my skin

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside, too
And your paranoia's probably worse

I don't know what set me off first
But I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter
Is I can't add up to what you can

But everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall

(And watches everything)
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watching you, too
Right inside your skin

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin

It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

[Interlude: Mike Shinoda]
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
(The sun) It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
(I feel the light betray me)

(The sun) It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
(I feel the light betray me)

It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

Groupie Love (feat. A$AP Rocky) by Lana Del Rey

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
You're in the bar, playin' guitar
I'm tryin' not to let the crowd next to me
It's so hard sometimes with the star
When you have to share him with everybody
You're in the club, livin' it up
I'm tryin' not to let the crowd notice me
It's so sweet, swingin' to the beat
When I know that you're doin' it all for me

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
And every time you look up
I know what you're thinkin' of
I know what you're thinkin' of

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
You want my
Groupie love

Time after time, writin' my lines
Havin' my baby there next to me
It's so sweet, pourin' you a drink
And pretendin' that nothin' means anything
This is my life, you by my side
Key lime and perfume and festivals
Takin' our dreams, turnin' them to things
It's like magic, babe, isn't life wonderful?

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
And every time we hook up
I know what you're thinkin' of

Front row, every show like a hype man (hmm)
Sing along word for word, watchin' my bae (yeah)
Side stage, fans screamin' causin' migraines
Yamborghini-high, but she ain't on my grade (hmm, hmm)
God dang, got a nigga actin' irate (hmm, hmm)
My babe, my babe, stay on my brain (yeah)
My babe, made me sing to a fire escape
City girl, but she grew up in the tri-state
She ain't got no time for no groupie love (hmm)
We don't pay no minds to the thug with a... (hmm)
Love girls, you and I, so who do we trust?
You and I 'til the day we die (You and I 'til the day we die)

[Part I: 911]

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
(Call me, call me, call me) Uh
(Call me, call me, call me) Uh
(Call me, call me, call me) Uh
(Call me, call me, call me)

(You should call me)
911, call me some time
911 (You should call me, oh)
911 (Call me)

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My thirst levels are infinity and beyond
Sippin' on that lemonade, I need a Beyoncé
Can't see straight, these shades are Céline Dion
Sucks you can't gas me up, shout out to Elon
Musk, yeah, I got a sold out show
Crowd wild out but don't matter 'cause you not front row
I've been lookin' for a keeper, listen to the speaker
If you fit description, hit me on my beeper
At that 911

[Bridge: Steve Lacy, Anna of the North & Tyler, The Creator]
Call me some time (ring, ring, ring)
Please bang my line, you know I'll answer (click)
Call me some time (ring, ring, ring)
Please bang my line

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Anna of the North]
Call me
911, call me some time
You should call me
911, call me some time
911, (you should call me, oh)
911, (you should call me)

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Chirp, chirp
Chirp, chirp
Woke up in the 'burbs, 'burbs, with the birds, birds
Where you used to come and get me with the swerve, swerve
These days you gotta find time
Even the night line
Work line
Dial nine

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Five car garage
Full tank of the gas
But that don't mean nothing, nothing
Nothin', nothin', without you shotgun in the passenger
I'm the loneliest man alive
But I keep on dancing to throw 'em off
I'm gon' run out of moves 'cause I can't groove to the blues
If you know any DJs, tell 'em to call me at 911...

[Part II: Mr. Lonely]

[Intro: A$AP Rocky, ScHoolboy Q, Lionel & Tyler, The Creator]
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old lonely ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Forreal, you need to go somewhere, like, get some bitches or something
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old weird ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely

[Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
They say the loudest in the room is weak
That's what they assume, but I disagree
I say the loudest in the room
Is prolly the loneliest one in the room (that's me)
Attention seeker, public speaker
Oh my God, that boy there is so fuckin' lonely
Writin' songs about these people
Who do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony
One thing I know, is that I wanna
Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago
Heart is low, it's real low, it's so low
You can't lift me up, I'm like Gallardo
From the start it's been real dark
It's been so dark, I guess that you could call me charbroiled, huh
I'm playin' like Hasbro
I'm really Saari, call me Arto
Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla
I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (skrrt)
But what the fuck else do you want from me?
That is the only thing keepin' me company
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed
These items is fillin' the void
Been fillin' it for so long
I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (ohh)
Current battle as an adult
My partner is a shadow
I need love, do you got some I could borrow?
Fuck it, I could find some tomorrow
But that never comes
Like a vasectomy, what have I done?
I got the talent, the face and the funds
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (who)
Mirror, mirror on the wall (who)
The loneliest of them all (me)
Cupid actin' stupid
Do you got another number I could call?
Never had a pet
I've never had a pet
There's more fish in the sea
But I never had a goldfish to begin with
I never had a dog
So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch
I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet
Treat me like direct deposit
Check in on me sometime
Ask me how I'm really doin'
So I never have to press that 911

[Outro: Jasper]
Ohh! Damn! Damn!

Leave Out All The Rest by Linkin Park

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I dreamed I was missing, you were so scared
But no one would listen 'cause no one else cared
After my dreaming, I woke with this fear
What am I leaving when I'm done here?

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
And don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Don't be afraid, I've taken my beating
I've shared what I made
I'm strong on the surface, not all the way through
I've never been perfect but neither have you

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
Don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Forgetting all the hurt inside
You've learned to hide so well
Pretending someone else
Can come and save me from myself
I can't be who you are

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some, reasons to be missed
Don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
Forgetting all the hurt inside
You've learned to hide so well
Pretending someone else
Can come and save me from myself

I can't be who you are
I can't be who you are

BURN IT DOWN by Linkin Park

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
The colors conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
You told me yes, you held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right to hold that crown
I built you up but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
And you were there, at the turn
Waiting to let me know

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

[Outro: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn
We can't wait to burn it to the ground
When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

Breaking the Habit by Linkin Park

[Verse 1]
Memories consume, like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to be the one
The battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize
That I'm the one confused

[Chorus]
I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean

I don't know how I got this way
I know it's not alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

[Verse 2]
Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more than anytime, before
I had no options left again

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to be the one
The battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize
That I'm the one confused

[Chorus]
I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean

I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

[Bridge]
I'll paint it on the walls
'Cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight, again
And this is how it ends

[Chorus]
I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity
To show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way

I'll never be alright
So, I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
I m breaking the habit tonight

White Mustang by Lana Del Rey

[Verse 1]
Packin' all my things for the summer
Lyin' on my bed, it's a bummer
'Cause I didn't call when I got your number
But I liked you a lot
Slippin' on my dress in soft filters
Everybody said you're a killer
But I couldn't stop the way I was feelin'
The day your record dropped

[Chorus]
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang

[Verse 2]
Caught up in my dreams and forgettin'
I've been actin' like armageddon 'cause you
Held me in your arms just a little too tight
That's what I thought
Summer's meant for lovin' and leavin'
I was such a fool for believin' that you
Could change all the ways you've been livin'
But you just couldn't stop

[Chorus]
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang

[Bridge]
You're revvin' and revvin' and revvin' it up
And the sound, it was frightenin'
And you were gettin' a part of that
You're gonna hit me like lightnin'

[Chorus]
White Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Said you're a wild mustang

[Outro]
You're gonna hit me like lightnin'
You're gonna hit me like lightnin'

Boredom by Tyler, The Creator

[Intro: Rex Orange County & Corinne Bailey]
When you're having fun, fun
Time flies, time flies, time flies

Boy, my bedroom floor is a cereal burial, I'm serious
I ate 'em all, dry boxes, bodies, yeah I caught 'em
If we're talkin' 'bout real meals, ask my stomach, he ain't saw 'em
I've been in this fuckin' room so long
My eyeballs are turning to drywall
My friends suck, fuck 'em, I'm over 'em
"Hi y'all, y'all ain't hit me all day
What the fuck is the problem? Is it me?
'Cause I'm not solved, I'm... bored."

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Bored and getting desperate as hell
(Desperate, using, texting, amusing)
Cellular not amusing and I hope someone will
Message me with some plans that are amusing as well
Cause I haven t seen the exit of these walls since before this morning
Morning, morning, morning, morning
(Morning, ohh, what the fuck?)
Got some cars I can handle but nowhere for performance
My stomach angry and yellin', I need some food, I could order
But I hate eating solo
Need someone, we can loiter in parking lots
As sunsets at the border, yeah
Ringy dingy dong, I can't be alone
I been starting to feel like I don't know anyone
So now I'm staring at my ceiling fuckin' going
Like I have no idea where I'm going
Tick tock
(Damn, gotta get outta here)

[Hook: Rex Orange County, Anna of the North and Tyler, the Creator]
Find some time
Find some time to do something
(Hey, can y'all help me right quick?)

Nobody Can Save Me by Linkin Park

[Verse 1]
I'm dancing with my demons
I'm hanging off the edge
Storm clouds gather beneath me
Waves break above my head
Headfirst hallucination

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I wanna fall wide awake now
You tell me it's alright
Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight

[Chorus]
But nobody can save me now
I'm holding up a light
I'm chasing out the darkness inside
'Cause nobody can save me

[Verse 2]
Stared into this illusion
For answers yet to come
I chose a false solution
But nobody proved me wrong
Headfirst hallucination

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I wanna fall wide awake
Watch the ground giving way now
You tell me it's alright
Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight

[Chorus]
But nobody can save me now
I'm holding up a light
I'm chasing out the darkness inside
'Cause nobody can save me

[Bridge]
Been searching somewhere out there
For what's been missing right here (I wanna fall wide awake now)
I've been searching somewhere out there
For what's been missing right here (I wanna fall wide awake now)
I wanna fall wide awake now
So tell me it's alright
Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight

[Outro]
And only I can save me now
I'm holding up a light
Chasing out the darkness inside
And I don't wanna let you down
But only I can save me!

Been searching somewhere out there
For what's been missing right here

Beautiful People Beautiful Problems (feat. Stevie Nicks) by Lana Del Rey

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
Blue is the color of the planet from the view above
Long live our reign, long live our love
Green is the planet from the eyes of a turtle dove
'Til it runs red, runs red with blood

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
We get so tired and we complain
'Bout how it's hard to live
It's more than just a video game

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
But we're just beautiful people
With beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
But we gotta try (Lie-la-lie)
Every day and night (Lie-la-lie)

[Verse 2: Stevie Nicks]
Blue is the collar of the shirt of the man I love
He's hard at work, hard to the touch
But warm is the body of the girl from the land he loves
My heart is soft, my past is rough

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Both]
But when I love him, get a feeling
Something close to like a sugar rush
It runs through me, but is it wasted love?
(Let's not waste it, love)

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Stevie Nicks, Both]
But we're just beautiful people
With beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
But we gotta try (Lie-la-lie)
Every day and night (Lie-la-lie)

[Bridge: Lana Del Rey, Both]
Yeah we've gotta try (Lie-la-lie)
We gotta walk through fire (Lie-la-lie)
Because we're just

[Chorus: Stevie Nicks, Both]
Beautiful people with beautiful problems, yeah
(We're just)
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
(Beautiful people)
Beautiful people with beautiful problems, yeah
(We're just)
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them

[Outro: Lana Del Rey & Stevie Nicks]
So beautiful
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah

Learn To Let Go by Kesha

[Verse 1]
Been a prisoner of the past
Had a bitterness when I looked back
Was telling everyone it's not that bad
 Til all my shit hit the fan

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I'm always like
Telling everybody you don't gotta be a victim
Life ain t always fair, but hell is living in resentment
Choose redemption, your happy ending's up to you

[Chorus]
I think it's time to practice what I preach
Exorcise the demons inside me
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go
The past can't haunt me if I don't let it
Live and learn and never forget it
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go

[Verse 2]
Had a boogieman under my bed
Putting crazy thoughts inside my head
Always whispering, "It's all your fault"
He was telling me, "No, you're not that strong"

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I'm always like
Telling everybody you don t gotta be a victim
Life ain t always fair, but hell is living in resentment
Choose redemption, your happy ending's up to you

[Chorus]
So, I think it s time to practice what I preach
Exorcise the demons inside me
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go
The past can't haunt me if I don't let it
Live and learn and never forget it
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go

[Post-Chorus]
Hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah
Hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah
Learn to let go, learn to let go
Hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah
Hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah
Learn to let go, learn to let go

[Bridge]
I'm done reliving my bad decisions
I see now maybe there s a reason why
I've been through hell and back
Yeah, honestly, it's all made me who I am
Holding on to wasted time
Gotta learn to let go in life

[Chorus]
So, I think it's time to practice what I preach
Exorcise the demons inside me
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go
The past can't haunt me if I don't let it
Live and learn and never forget it
Whoa, gotta learn to let it go

[Post-Chorus]
Hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah
Hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah
Learn to let go, learn to let go
Hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah
Hey-eh-eh-eh, yeah
Learn to let go, learn to let go

And I was beginning to fuck with ya

Yeah, won't lie and say I don't lie
Yeah, I might've told a few lies, yeah
Won t lie and say I didn t try
But you're only worth a few tries, yeah
Track star, think you re running these streets
You ain't the only one running the streets
Stay making ground like I only wear cleats, yeah

Didn't know the real me, I'm far from an angel)
Who said I was an angel? (Never took the time out
Never had time to figure me out, when you look at me)
When you look at me, what do you see? (Oh, what do you see?)
Open your eyes, I'm more brilliant than you'll ever be, yeah
Who said I was an angel?
(Who said I was a, an angel? Oh)

Friend Of Mine (feat. Vargas & Lagola) by Avicii

[Verse 1]
Hey
Do you remember we said, "Hello"?
And you asked me about my Levi's T-shirt
Said, "You are a friend of mine"
My, oh my
You must have saved me about a thousand times
I wouldn't be the one I am today
If you hadn't been a friend of mine

[Chorus]
I ain't misbehaving
I'm just telling you the truth
Take my love for granted
Yeah, I'll give it all to you
Made me count for something
Yeah, I feel it in my heart
God only knows what I'd have been if you hadn't been

[Post-Chorus/Drop]
A friend of mine

[Verse 2]
Hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I haven't seen you around since high school
How you doin', do you still remember me?
Are you still a friend of mine?
Guess you're still a friend of mine
Guess you're still a friend of mine
Now I see
I see
Why I get nervous when you look at me
It's like your eyes are trying to tell me something
That you're more than just a friend of mine
That you're more than just a friend of mine, oh my

[Chorus]
I ain't misbehaving

What Would I Change It To (feat. AlunaGeorge) by Avicii

[Verse 1]
Steady yourself even though you know that you're falling
Maybe you're falling, but you're still alive
Ready yourself, that's quite enough of your bawlin'
'Cause baby, you're bawling, but you'll survive
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Losing is only a sign
It's only a sign that you really tried, really tried
Losing is only a sign
It's only a sign that you really tried, really tried

[Chorus]
Forever trading places with the same old me
I'm racking up the cases of who I failed to be
Why would I replace the sky?
Why would I recreate that perfect blue?
What would I change it to?
Oh, won't you tell me
What would I change it to?
Oh, won't you tell me
What would I change it to?

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
You can copy and paste your head on a new body
But that new body's still made of flesh
And cutting corners gets you where you're going
But how you get there is the real test

[Pre-Chorus]
And losing is only a sign
It's only a sign that you really tried, really tried
And losing is only a sign
It's only a sign that you really tried, really tried

[Chorus]
Forever trading places with the same old me
I'm racking up the cases of who I failed to be
Why would I replace the sky?
Why would I recreate that perfect blue?
What would I change it to?
Oh, won't you tell me
What would I change it to?
Oh, won't you tell me
What would I change it to?

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Younger Now by Miley Cyrus

[Verse 1]
Feels like I just woke up
Like all this time I've been asleep
Even though it's not who I am
I'm not afraid of who I used to be

[Chorus]
No one stays the same (Oh, oh)
You know what goes up must come down (Oh, oh)
Change is a thing you can count on (Oh, oh)
I feel so much younger now (oh, oh)

But never make it to the end
My eyes open when they feel the light
It's always right before I'm about to scream

No one stays the same (Oh, oh)
You know what goes up must come down (Oh, oh)
Change is a thing you can count on (Oh, oh)
I feel so much younger now (Oh, oh)

[Bridge]
What goes up must come down
What goes up must come down
What goes up must come down
What goes up must come down (Yeah)

Orlando by XXXTENTACION

[Verse]
The pain in my heart just won't end
The words that I find just don't seem to compare
Awaiting my death in the end
Alone, I must seek out the end to begin
So nobody wants death
'Cause nobody wants life to end
I'm the only one stressed
And the only one tired of having fake friends
Put the noose on my neck
And the hole in my back, again
I've been waiting on death with a smile on my face
So this is the end
Waste of tears
Waste of years and months
Faced my fears
Loving her for once
Hurt me
Break my heart
Worthless
Can't keep love at all
Turning, twist myself
Worthless
Can't keep love at all, at all

When you feel the world around you
Spinnin' out of control
You can find someone around you
To bring you out of the cold
But you don't ever have to hide
What you really feel inside

Walk On Water by Thirty Seconds To Mars

[Intro]
(Do you believe?) Walk on water

[Verse 1]
Can you even see what you're fighting for?
Blood lust and a holy war
Listen up, hear the patriot shout:
"Times are changing"
In the end, the choice was clear
Take a shot in the face of fear
Fist up in the firing line
Times are changing

[Chorus]
Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?
(Do you believe?)

[Verse 2]
Look at the sky, see a dying star
White lies, it's a man on fire
Making love with the devil hurts
Times are changing
A thin line, the whole truth
The far right, the left view
Breaking all those promises made
Times are changing

[Chorus]
Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?
Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?

Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water

Do you believe? Walk on water
Do you believe? Walk on water

Do you believe that you can walk on water?
Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight?
Do you believe? Walk on water

[Monologue: XXXTENTACION]
17. A collection of nightmares, thoughts, and real-life situations I've lived. 17 is the number tattooed on the right side of my head, my own personal number, soon to be explained in future interviews or instances. By listening to this album, you are literally, and I cannot stress this enough, literally entering my mind. And if you are not willing to accept my emotion and hear my words fully, do not listen. I do not value your money; I value your acceptance and loyalty. Here is my pain and thoughts put into words. I put my all into this in the hopes that it will help cure, or at least numb, your depression. I love you. Thank you for listening. Enjoy.

...Ready For It? by Taylor Swift

[Verse 1]
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

[Verse 2]
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know (No one has to know)

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?
Oh, are you ready for it?

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night (Night), in my dreams (My dreams)
You should see the things we do (We do), baby (Baby), hmm (Eh)
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (My dreams)
I know I'm gonna be with you (I know I'm gonna be with you)
So I take my time
In the middle of the night

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Can t nobody get up in my car today
Back seat feeling like a charter plane
Bumping Silkk Da Shocker Charge It 2 Da Game
Paint dripping like I m whipping marmalade (whoa)
Look at the way that I m shining
I don t be checking the mileage
She said how much is that Rolie?
I said don t worry I m timeless
Watching Toy Story 3, that s a great fucking movie
City of Jimi, Kurt, Quincy
City of me, Eddie, and Bruce Lee (whoa)
King of the road I drive slow like whoa
And I just switched over to Geico like whoa
Celebrating these life goals
But you ain t getting no ride home

[Chorus]
I be riding through the town
My music loud
Windows down yeah you can hear me now
I turn it up, I need that bass
And my chain so bright can t see my face
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
All eyes on me now
I be riding through Seatown
Taking pics when I eat out
Girls ask me to freestyle
Neighbors hate it when I speed out
I ain t turning these beats down
GPS and I reroute
Chuck the deuce and I peace out
Sun roof tinted, don't need your opinions
I be on my business, and you be on Tinder
And if I was single, I d be right there with ya
But I m committed, keep my dick in my britches
The women are moving their bodies
Sunset through numerous palm trees
Followed by the paparazzi
But they don t get into our party
Tell the bell hop that I m sorry
We 40 deep in the lobby
Travel the world with a posse
But soon I ll be home
So call up my momma and tell her to pick up the phone
Cause I need that homemade lasagna that s fresh out the stove
Grabbing the keys and I m fresh out the door
King of my city whose next on the throne

[Chorus]
I be riding through the town
My music loud
Windows down yeah you can hear me now
I turn it up, I need that bass
And my chain so bright can t see my face
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town

[Verse 3: Lil Yachty]
When you hear that speaker sound, ound, ound
You know who it is, Lil Boat in your town
Whoa this beat so happy I will never frown
And my hair so nappy it s gonna be a problem braiding it down
Oh no, oh no, we been grinding from the go
Jump start, I just bought a new whip, push start
Push the coup down the highway like a go kart
All my niggas keep that toaster with them like a Pop Tart
Make her moan and she sound just like Mozart
Pure art
I think they mad because I broke into the game with a crowbar
Top the charts, Hip Hop ain t the same we the new stars
Rock stars, look at all my chains call them ice pops
Ring pops, let the rain drop on the wrist watch
Fuck the cops, and fuck Donald Trump, bitch it s Macklemore and Lil Boat
Anything else you need to know

[Chorus]
I be riding through the town
My music loud
Windows down yeah you can hear me now
I turn it up, I need that bass
And my chain so bright can t see my face
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town, town, town
I be riding through the town

He can't just get away with it
Eye for eye, you piece of sh 
You treat us like a garbage pit
Let me at him, wait for it, wait for it, wait for it
Here's that singin' part again
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)

[Pre-Hook: P!nk]
I'm daydreamin' (I'm daydreamin')
Let me count the ways (let me count the ways)
How I'll get you (how I'll get you)
Or how I'll make you pay (you pay)
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
Babe, I'm hurtin' (I'm hurtin')
And now you'll feel the same (feel the same)
That's my plan, that's my plan, that's my plan

[Hook: P!nk]
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (revenge is sweet)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Well, in the beginning we
Felt like we was meant to be
I fell for you and skinned my knee
But hell, with any injury, eventually you'll get up gingerly
Feels like it'll take a century to heal
But just know that I will
(Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm)
But fuck tryna make amends, I'd rather take revenge
You're stickin' safety pins inside my atrium
Your day begins at 8 p.m.
You hit the ATM in my Mercedes Benz
With all your lady friends whores!
Hit the club and you go out
Don't know a sum, 'cause when I calculate
The times you cheated and I total up all the amounts
It doesn't add up, 'cause you say that just givin' out your number doesn't count, get it? (I hate you)
And then see me with someone new, get mad and flip it, look how bad you spin it
First you turn your back on me, then tell me that I stabbed you in it?!
(Stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it
Stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it, SLUT!)
So when you're driving, driving to his house
And you pass me, while I'm drivin' to hers
Just remember, you cheated on me first (bitch!)
You're a whore, you're a whore, this is war
Fellas, ladies

[Hook: Eminem & P!nk]
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together (oh-ohh)
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (so sweet, oh-ohh)
(Mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm)
We could do revenge revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet

Beautiful Trauma by P!nk

[Verse 1]
We were on fire
I slashed your tires
It's like we burn so bright, we burn out
I made you chase me
I wasn't that friendly
My love, my drug, we're fucked up, oh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause I've been on the run so long they can't find me
You're waking up to remember I'm pretty
And when the chemicals leave my body
Yeah, they're gonna find me in a hotel lobby 'cause
Mmm, tough
Times they keep comin'
All night
Laughin' and fuckin'
Some days like I'm barely breathin'
After we were high and the love dope died it was you

[Chorus]
The pill I keep takin'
The nightmare I wake in
There's nothin', no nothin', nothin' but you
My perfect rock bottom
My beautiful trauma
My love, my love, my drug, oh

[Post-Chorus]
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, (oh) my love, my drug, we're fucked up

[Verse 2]
You punched a hole in
The wall and I framed it
I wish I could feel things like you
Everyone's chasing
That holy feeling
And if we don't stay lit we'll blow out
Blow out

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause we've been on the run so long they can't find us
Who's gonna have to die to remind us
That it feels like we chose this blindly
Now I'm gonna fuck up a hotel lobby
'Cause these tough
Times they keep comin'
Last night
I might have messed it up again
Some days like I'm barely breathin'
But after we were high and the love dope died it was you

[Chorus]
The pill I keep takin'
The nightmare I wake in
There's nothin', no nothin', nothin' but you
My perfect rock bottom
My beautiful trauma
My love, my love, my drug, oh

[Post-Chorus]
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
(My drug) my love, my love, my drug, we're fucked up

[Bridge]
Mmm tough
Times they keep comin'
All night
Laughin' and fuckin'
Some days like I'm barely breathin'
After we were high and the love dope died it was you

[Chorus]
The pill I keep takin'
The nightmare I wake in
There's nothin', no nothin', nothin' but you
My perfect rock bottom
My beautiful trauma
My love, my love, my drug, oh (drug)

This Town by Niall Horan

[Verse 1]
Waking up to kiss you and nobody s there
The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
It s hard
Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running round
It s funny how things never change in this old town
So far from the stars

[Pre-Chorus]
And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

[Chorus]
If the whole world was watching I d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

[Verse 2]
I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met he s got his arms around you
It s so hard
So hard

[Pre-Chorus]
And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

[Chorus]
Because if the whole world was watching I d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when I m next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you

[Bridge]
And I know that it s wrong
That I can t move on
But there s something about you

[Chorus]
If the whole world was watching I d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when I m next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
Everything comes back to you

New by Daya

When you walk past
That park near your apartment now
Do you think about me?
Do you think about me?

Do you drive fast
When you realize you re on my street?
Do you drive slowly?
Do you think about me?

Thought I could pack up my suitcase
And just walk away (walk away)
Leave you with all of the shit I didn t want to take
My mistake

I m missing you

What the hell did I do   did I do?
Messing with someone new

Whiskey (feat. A$AP Rocky) by Maroon 5

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Leaves are fallin', it's September
The night came in, it made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young 'til she kissed me
Like a whiskey, like a whiskey

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
I never knew that love was blind
'Til I was hers, but she was never mine
Yeah, I was reckless
But I let it burn, I let it burn, yeah
The feelin', it was bittersweet
Realizin' I was in too deep
She was a lesson
I had to learn, I had to learn, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I used to try to forget her
But now I smile when I remember
Ooh

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Leaves are fallin' in September
The night came in, it made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young 'til she kissed me
Like a whiskey, like a whiskey
Ooh, like a whiskey, ooh

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
Would've left this world behind
Just to wake up by your side
Every mornin', I would've sold my soul for a lil' more time
Would've waited a thousand nights
If she never said goodbye
I admit that I
Would've sold my soul for a little more time
Ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I used to try to forget her
But now I smile when I remember

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Leaves are fallin', it's September
The night came in, it made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young 'til she kissed me
Like a whiskey, like a whiskey

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
I ain't like the other Cognacs
Or type of cat that'd never call back
Or lose contact when you runnin' out of rum and you make a run
(Feelin' light and dizzy, might be tipsy)
All of that tequila's a killer, little vodka
Break her off somethin' proper
Pop a cork and play spin the bottle
(Every time you kiss me, like some whiskey)
Punch drunk love, it's a fine line
Dom Pérignon, she the fine wine
Someone call 911, I'm runnin' out of time
She done got off with my heart

[Chorus: Adam Levine & (A$AP Rocky)]
Leaves are fallin', it's September (oh)
The night came in, it made her shiver
I told her she could have my jacket
Wrapped it tight around her shoulders
And I was so young (so young)
'Til she kissed me (yeah)
Like a whiskey (yeah)
And I was so young (so young)
'Til she kissed me
Like a whiskey, like a whiskey

On The Loose by Niall Horan

[Verse 1]
I know what she's like, she's out of her mind
And wraps herself around the truth
She'll jump on that flight and meet you that night
And make you tear up the room

[Pre-Chorus]
She loves when everybody's watching
She knows the way her body moves
She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
That she loves nobody else but you

[Chorus]
She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming)
She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming for you)
She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming)
She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming for you)

[Verse 2]
She'll dance in the dark, a real work of art
Her eyes could burn down the room
So get out while you can, you don't understand
She doesn't know how to lose

[Pre-Chorus]
She loves when everybody's watching
She knows the way her body moves
She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
That she loves nobody else but you

[Chorus]
She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming)
She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming for you)
She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming)
She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming for you)

[Bridge]
She'll run with your mind and pull you in tight
Then trade you in for something new
I know what it's like, I fell for it twice
And now I'm just warning you

[Pre-Chorus]
She loves when everybody's watching
She knows the way her body moves
She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
That she loves nobody else but you
She loves when everybody's watching
She knows the way her body moves
She loves the way they all crawl back when she says
She loves nobody else but you

[Chorus]
She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming)
She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming for you)
She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming)
She's on the loose (she's coming, she's coming for you)
She's on the loose
She's on the loose

Keep an R&B bitch in my lap
Out in Beverly Hills, I adapt
But I still had to ride with that strap

One-point-five in my Goyard, huh
Gon' need a way bigger surfboard, huh
I bust down my plain Yachtmaster with bezels
I flew her out to Vegas, swear to God, forgot to hit her
I made 'em quit they jobs, then I gave 'em to my niggas
I gave her a little start-up money and put her in a rental
I send my Ethiopian to go pray at the temple
I flood her heart with diamonds, just to pray, it's so expensive
She tastin' holy water, so for me, it's beneficial
She caught the holy ghost when I gave her the Presidential

Rockin' Maison Margielas, that's cap

Burning by Sam Smith

[Intro]
I've been burnin', yes, I've been burnin'
Such a burden, this flame on my chest
No insurance, to pay for the damage
Yeah, I've been burnin' up since you left

[Verse 1]
I've been smokin', oh, more than twenty a day
Blame it on rebellion, don't blame it on me
Wish I was younger back to the nineteenth of May
I had an open mind, swore to never change

[Pre-Chorus]
Funny how time goes by
Had respect for myself that river ran dry
You reached a limit, I wasn't enough
It's like the fire replaced all the love

[Chorus]
I've been burnin', yes, I've been burnin'
Such a burden, this flame on my chest
No insurance, to pay for the damage
Yeah, I've been burnin' up since you left

[Verse 2]
Oh, if you ever called, I will run straight back
Give you my forgiveness and the shirt off my back
No friends to turn to, yeah, I messed up that
Wish we could smoke again, just for a day, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Funny how time goes by
Had respect for myself that river ran dry
You reached a limit, I wasn't enough
And it's like the fire replaced all the love

[Chorus]
I've been burnin', yes, I've been burnin'
Such a burden, this flame on my chest
No insurance, to pay for the damage
Yeah, I've been burnin' up since you left

[Outro]
Yeah, I've been burnin' up since you left
Oh, I've been burnin' up since you left

Midnight Train by Sam Smith

[Verse 1]
I choose me, and I know that's selfish, love
You are a dream, and I can't thank you enough
But I give another piece of me away
Every wakin' day that I'm with you
Am I a monster? What will your family think of me?
They brought me in, they helped me out with everything
But I give a little piece of me away
Every single day

[Chorus]
So I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train
I got my reasons, but darlin', I can't explain
I'll always love you
But tonight's the night I choose to walk away
Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo
Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo

[Verse 2]
Love you so much that I have to let you go
I'll miss your touch and the secrets we both know
But it would be wrong for me to stay
And I'll just give you hope

[Chorus]
So I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train
I got my reasons, but darlin', I can't explain
I'll always love you
But tonight's the night I choose to walk away
I can't stop cryin', I hate that I've caused you pain
But I can't deny it, I just don't feel the same
I'll always love you
But tonight's the night I choose to walk away
Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo
Bah-bah, doo, bah-bah, doo
So I pick up the pieces, I get on the midnight train
I got my reasons, but darlin', I can't explain
I'll always love you
But tonight's the night I choose to walk away

Kids in Love (feat. The Night Game) by Kygo

[Verse 1: The Night Game]
This is our last goodbye
Don't come and find me
So hard to see you cry
Please, somebody blind me

[Pre-Chorus 1: The Night Game]
'Cause I can feel it
I'm still lagging onto every word
My heart is beating
And I'm sorry that I left you hurt

[Chorus: The Night Game]
We were kids in love
And then we grew up
But won't you hold me close tonight
Like we're kids in love?
Kids in love
Kids in love
Kids in love

[Post-Chorus: The Night Game]
We were kids in love
We were kids in love

[Verse 2: The Night Game & Maja Francis]
Engine on, in the drive
Running for hours
Slowly, we twist the knife in
Folding like towers

[Pre-Chorus 2: The Night Game & Maja Francis]
And I can feel it
And we're running out of hope tonight
I hear you breathing
As we're hanging on to you and I, oh

[Chorus: The Night Game & Maja Francis]
We were kids in love
And then we grew up
But won't you hold me close tonight
Like we're kids in love?
Kids in love (Oh)
Kids in love (Oh)
Kids in love (Oh)

[Outro: The Night Game & Maja Francis]
Maybe I could cope if I could hold you
We were kids in love
One last time, one last time
And wherever you go, I'll just hold you forever
Maybe I could cope if I could hold you
We were kids in love
Kids in love (Oh)
Kids in love (Oh)
Kids in love (Oh)

HIM by Sam Smith

[Verse 1]
Holy Father, we need to talk
I have a secret that I can't keep
I'm not the boy that you thought you wanted
Please don't get angry, have faith in me

[Chorus]
Say I shouldn't be here but I can't give up his touch
It is him I love, it is him
Don't you try and tell me that God doesn't care for us
It is him I love, it is him I love

[Verse 2]
I walk the streets of Mississippi
I hold my lover by the hand
I feel you staring when he is with me
How can I make you understand?

[Chorus]
Say I shouldn't be here but I can't give up his touch
It is him I love, it is him
Don't you try and tell me that God doesn't care for us
It is him I love, it is him I love

[Bridge]
Ohh, ohh
Oh, I love
Ohh, ohh
No, no, I love
Ohh, ohh
I love
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh
Him I love
Ohh, ohh
Him I love
Ohh, ohh
Him I love
Ohh, ohh
Him I love

[Outro]
Holy Father, judge my sins
I'm not afraid of what they will bring
I'm not the boy that you thought you wanted
I love him

Baby, You Make Me Crazy by Sam Smith

[Verse 1]
You say that you're leavin', but I don't think I can let go
When you put the phone down, I began to cry
What are you to do, when the person that you love just says no?
Boy, get yourself together, move on with your life

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'm gonna play my favourite rhythm
Got to get you out my system
I would do anything to keep you off my mind
I'm gonna have to call my sisters
Be around the ones who listen
Anything to drown you out tonight

[Chorus]
Baby, you make me crazy
Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
Save me, make it all hazy
So I don't think about you till tomorrow

[Verse 2]
It wasn't enough, but you could've had the guts to face me
It would have meant so much, if you'd looked me in the eye
Why do I always fall for the ones who have no courage?
I must see some kind of beauty in their lies

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'm gonna play my favourite rhythm
Got to get you out my system
I would do anything to keep you off my mind
I'm gonna have to call my sisters
Be around the ones who listen
Anything to drown you out tonight

[Chorus]
Baby, you make me crazy
Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
Save me, make it all hazy
So I don't think about you till tomorrow
Baby, you make me crazy
Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
Save me, make it all hazy
So I don't think about you till tomorrow
Baby, you make me crazy
Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
Save me, make it all hazy
So I don't think about you till tomorrow

Nothing Left For You by Sam Smith

[Verse 1]
Maybe I'm done, maybe it's true
Maybe I had one chance and I lost it with you
We fell so hard, with nothing to lose
I'll never love again, I'll never love you

[Chorus]
'Cause I gave my heart to a goddamn fool
I gave him everything
Now there's nothing left for you
'Cause I gave (I gave)
My heart (My heart)
To a goddamn fool
Oh, I lost everything
Now I have nothing left for you
I have nothing left for you

[Verse 2]
Mm, I can't pretend, pretend that I care
I see how you look at me, but I am not there
The damage is done, I'll save you the time
And if there are feelings there, they are not mine

[Chorus]
'Cause I gave (I gave)
My heart (My heart)
To a goddamn fool
I gave him everything
Now there's nothing left for you
'Cause I gave (I gave)
My heart (My heart)
To a goddamn fool
I lost everything
And I have nothing left for you
Oh, I have nothing left for you

[Bridge]
You won't hear me say those words again
This is something that you cannot mend
Can't you see I am a product of my own past?
So I know this will never last
And I will not cover your fears
I will not pick up your tears
I'll live out the rest of my days alone

[Chorus]
'Cause I gave my heart to a goddamn fool
I gave him everything
Now there's nothing left for you
'Cause I gave my heart to a goddamn fool
I lost everything
And I have nothing left for you

My Choppa Hate Niggas by 21 Savage

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
I can show you how to fit an M in a duffel
Show you how to fit a hundred bags in a duffel
Went and bought a Demon, nigga, just to burn rubber
Bitch, you bad as fuck, I might just hit you with no rubber
On that Slaughter Gang shit, bitch, we knife talking
Nigga, I ain't making no diss songs, we be white chalking
All my niggas dogs and we like to bite, don't it?
Glock 30 .45 with the mic on it
Going brazy, niggas think I need a psych, don't it
If I can't finesse 'em I'ma put the pipe on 'em
Niggas pussy, they can't wait to turn to mice on ya
12 catch ya, they gon' put the blue lights on ya

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Hang around a lot of gang bangin' ass niggas
Crip, Blood, blue or red, what you bang, nigga?
You might got a pistol but this stick is way bigger
I call it KKK 'cause my choppa hate niggas
Hang around a lot of gang bangin' ass niggas
Crip, Blood, blue or red, what you bang, nigga?
You might got a pistol but this stick is way bigger
I call it KKK 'cause my choppa hate niggas

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
You do a lot of talking, nigga, not me
Do a lot of walking, nigga, that's me
Finna open up a morgue, all this damn beef
Choppa with the sword, Game of Thrones .223
Max out, Tee Tay down the road, finna max out
Late night, pullin' in the 'partments, all the scraps out
Scraps out, make the wrong move, get clapped out
Don't you think I'm slippin' just because a nigga rap now
Got a hoodie, man, I'm the boogie man
We on that bullshit, man, walk around with Uzis, man
This a Mulsanne, not a Mustang
Let the 30 hang, nigga, I'm so gang

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Hang around a lot of gang bangin' ass niggas
Crip, Blood, blue or red, what you bang, nigga?
You might got a pistol but this stick is way bigger
I call it KKK 'cause my choppa hate niggas
Hang around a lot of gang bangin' ass niggas
Crip, Blood, blue or red, what you bang, nigga?
You might got a pistol but this stick is way bigger
I call it KKK 'cause my choppa hate niggas

Palace by Sam Smith

[Verse 1]
My head is filled with ruins
Most of them, I built with you
Now the dust no longer moves
Don't disturb the ghost of you, mmm
They are empty, they are worn
Tell me what we built this for
On my way to somethin' more
You're that one I can't ignore, mmm

[Chorus]
I'm gonna miss you
I still care
Sometimes I wish we never built this palace
But real love is never a waste of time, mmm

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I know just what you're sayin'
And I regret ever complainin'
About this heart and all its breakin'
It was beauty we were makin', mmm
And I know we'll both move on
You'll forgive what I did wrong
They will love the better you
But I still own the ghost of you, mmm

[Chorus]
I'm gonna miss you
I'm still there
Sometimes I wish we never built this palace
But real love is never a waste of time, oh
I'm gonna miss you
I'm still there
Sometimes I wish we'd never built this palace
But real love is never a waste of time
But real love is never a waste of time

Scars by Sam Smith

[Verse 1]
This is for my mother
From the older brother of your children, made of three
Now you found your lover
'Cause it wasn't our father who made you laugh and happy
It's been a long five years
I've cried a thousand tears, and here we are, after the war
But we're so much better
Now the skies are clearer, now there's no more slammin' doors

[Chorus]
Now, I say
Dear Mother, how you've come so far
Your love has fixed all of our broken hearts
I hope you're proud, Mother, of what you've done
It's a lifelong lesson and I'm not pretendin' when I say
You cleared up my scars
You cleared up my scars

[Verse 2]
This is for my father
From the older brother of your children made of three
Yeah, you've been so good to us
And showed us how to live and taught us to be free
But when Mother told you
That she didn't love you, all these bridges hit the sea
So you built another one
And helped us cross it, even though you were in need

[Chorus]
Now, I say
Dear Father, how you've come so far
Your love has fixed all of our broken hearts
I hope you're proud, Father, of what you've done
It's a lifelong lesson and I'm not pretendin' when I say
You cleared up my scars
You cleared up my scars
You cleared up my scars
You cleared up my scars

[Outro]
Dear Mother, how you've come so far
Your love has fixed all of our broken hearts
I hope you're proud, Mother, of what you've done
It's a lifelong lesson and I'm not pretendin' when I say
You cleared up my scars

The Thrill Of It All by Sam Smith

[Verse 1]
I regret that I told the world
That you were with me
And I regret how I showed the world
That you were pretty
I never thought I'd learn so much
So much from bein' lonely
But I guess I didn't learn enough
'Cause now you won't hold me

[Chorus]
I guess I got lost in the moment
I guess I got lost in the fall
I guess I got lost in your heartbeat
In the thrill of it all
And I guess you were goddamn perfect
'Cause every single time you call
I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love
In the thrill of it all
In the thrill of it all

[Verse 2]
Even though we weren't in love
It was far from lust
Yeah, you were beautiful
But in you I could trust
Others, they warned my heart
They said I would lose fast
They said that you were stoppin' ground
And soon to be my past

[Chorus]
I guess I got lost in the moment
I guess I got lost in the fall
I guess I got lost in your heartbeat
In the thrill of it all
And I guess you were goddamn perfect
'Cause every single time you call
I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love
In the thrill of it all, oh
In the thrill of it all

[Outro]
And I guess you were goddamn perfect
'Cause every single time you call
I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love
I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love
I remind myself of what I lost that night, my love
In the thrill of it all

One Day At A Time by Sam Smith

[Verse 1]
Let's turn off our phones tonight
And rely on the stars
We've been so lost lately
We forgot who we are
But I got everything I need, baby
In the palms of your touch
In a world of dark distractions
It can all get too much

[Chorus]
So let's sit by an English river
Till the water runs dry
Can we light a cigarette
And talk about days gone by?
We're neither saints or sinners
So leave your history behind
Let's grab a bottle and take it one day at a time
Take it one day at a time

[Verse 2]
I know you're feelin' weighed down tonight
And you can't find the breaks
Every day is too long for you
You are sworn to your fate
But we got everything we need, baby
In the memories we make
In a world of reinventions
It's never too late

[Chorus]
So let's sit by an English river
Till the water runs dry
Can we light a cigarette
And talk about days gone by?
We're neither saints or sinners
So leave your history behind
Let's grab a bottle and take it one day at a time
Take it one day at a time, mmm
Oh, so let's sit by an English river
Till the water runs dry
There is nothin' that we've done wrong
That can't be made right
We're neither saints or sinners
So leave your history behind
Let's grab a bottle and take it
Grab a bottle and take it
Grab a bottle and take it one day at a time

Awful Things by Lil Peep

[Intro: Lil Peep]
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you do that
Helps me get through this without you

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you do that
Helps me get through this without you
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you move that on me
Love it when you do that on me

[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
You like attention, I find it obvious
She makes it obvious for me
She feels the tension
It's just the two of us, it's just the two of us, tonight
Burn me down 'til I'm nothin' but memories
I get it, girl (I get it, girl)
I get it, girl
Burn me down 'til I'm nothin' but memories
I get it, girl (I get it, girl)
I'm not the one

Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you move that on me
Love it when you do that on me

[Verse 2: Lil Tracy]
Don't you turn your back on me
Let your teardrops fall on me
Speeding away, the city in the rear view
Heart racing whenever I'm near you
GothBoi jumpin' off stage
Carry me away, carry me away
Burn me down 'til there's nothing left
I would scream your name with my last breath
Take off your favorite dress
Lay your head on my chest
Diamonds, rubies and gems
You can have all of them

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you do that
Helps me get through this without you
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you move that on me
Love it when you do that on me

I Did Something Bad by Taylor Swift

[Verse 1]
I never trust a narcissist, but they love me
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look oh-so-easy
'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about is me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing
I don't regret it one bit, 'cause he had it coming

[Chorus]
They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

[Hook]
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Da-da da-da

[Verse 2]
I never trust a playboy, but they love me
So I fly 'em all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
They never see it comin', what I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can feel the flames on my skin
He says, "Don't throw away a good thing"
But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothin'
And if he spends my change, then he had it comin'

[Chorus]
They say I did something bad(oh)
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

[Hook]
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
(It just felt so good)
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Da-da da-da

[Bridge]
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
They got their pitchforks and proof, their receipts and reasons
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
So light me up (Light me up), light me up (Light me up)
Light me up, go ahead and light me up (Light me up)
Light me up (Light me up), light me up (Light me up)
Light me up (Light me up), light me up

[Chorus]
They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

[Hook]
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Da-da da-da

[Outro]
Oh, you say I did something bad
(You say I did something bad?)
Why's it feel so good, good?
So bad, why's it feel so good?
Why's it feel, why's it feel so good? (Bad)
It just felt so good, good

Miss You by Louis Tomlinson

[Verse 1]
Is it my imagination?
Is it something that I m taking?
All the smiles that I m faking
 Everything is great
Everything is fucking great 
Going out every weekend
Staring at the stars on the ceiling
Hollywood friends, gotta see them
Such a good time
I believe it this time

[Pre-Chorus]
Tuesday night
Glazed over eyes
Just one more pint or five
Does it even matter anyway?

[Chorus]
We re dancing on tables
And I m off my face
With all of my people
And it couldn t get better they say
We re singing 'til last call
And it s all out of tune
Should be laughing, but there s something wrong
And it hits me when the lights go on
Shit, maybe I miss you

[Verse 2]
Just like that and I m sober
I m asking myself,  Is it over? 
Maybe I was lying when I told you
 Everything is great
Everything is fucking great 
And all of these thoughts and the feelings
Cheers to that if you don t need them
I ve been checking my phone all evening
Such a good time
I believe it this time

[Pre-Chorus]
Tuesday night
Glazed over eyes
Just one more pint or five
Does it even matter anyway?

[Chorus]
We re dancing on tables
And I m off my face
With all of my people
And it couldn t get better they say
We re singing 'til last call
And it s all out of tune
Should be laughing, but there s something wrong
And it hits me when the lights go on
Shit, maybe I miss you

[Bridge]
Now I m asking my friends how to say  I m sorry 
They say  Lad, give it time, there s no need to worry 
And we can t even be on the phone now
And I can t even be with you alone now
Oh, how shit changes
We were in love, now we re strangers
When I feel it coming up, I just throw it all away
Get another two shots 'cause it doesn t matter anyway

[Chorus]
We re dancing on tables
And I m off my face
With all of my people
And it couldn t get better they say
We re singing 'til last call
And it s all out of tune
Should be laughing, but there s something wrong
And it hits me when the lights go on
We re dancing on tables
And I m off my face
With all of my people
And it couldn t get better they say
We re singing 'til last call
And it s all out of tune
Should be laughing, but there s something wrong
And it hits me when the lights go on
Shit, maybe I ll miss you

Don t Blame Me by Taylor Swift

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Verse 1]
I've been breakin' hearts a long time
And toyin' with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shakin', pacin', I just need you

[Pre-Chorus]
For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say, "She's gone too far this time"

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Verse 2]
My name is whatever you decide
And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby (Your baby)
Echoes of your name inside my mind
Halo hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And baby, for you, I would fall from grace
Just to touch your face
If you walk away, I'd beg you on my knees to stay

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Bridge]
I get so high, oh!
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
You're lovin' me
Trip of my life, oh!
Every time you're, every time you're touchin' me
You're touchin' me
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
(Usin' for the rest of my life, oh!)

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (Doin' it right, no!)
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life, oh
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (You ain't doin' it right)
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (I'll be usin', I'll be usin')

[Outro]
I get so high, oh!
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
You're lovin' me
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Call It What You Want by Taylor Swift

[Verse 1]
My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown, but it's alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doin' better than I ever was
'Cause

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Verse 2]
All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Bridge]
I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck
Chain 'round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say, I
I recall late November
Holding my breath, slowly, I said
"You don't need to save me
But would you run away with me?"
Yes (Would you run away?)

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Outro]
(Call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
Call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want  to

Untouchable by Eminem

Pt. I

[Intro]
Hands up, officer don t shoot
Then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot
We may never understand each other, it s no use
We ain t ever gonna grasp what each other goes through

[Verse 1]
Black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you
Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you
Pull up on the side of you
Window rolled down, 'profile'
Then we wonder why we see this side of you
Probably comin' from the dope house
We could let you slide but your tail light is blew, out
We know you're hidin' that Heidi Klum
On you another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you
And just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true
Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it
In your back, then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
Fucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?
I keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'
No matter how many lives you ruin
It's for the red, white and blue
Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
No one's ever indicted you
Why? 'Cause you're a...

[Chorus: Eminem & Cheech and Chong]
White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
The world's coming to an end, I don't even care
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar

[Verse 2]
Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man
Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
Balderdash, where d you get the chip on your shoulder at?
Why you kicking that soda can?
Pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and
Throw your ass in the van cuffed
You don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are
Our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands
And put our minds more at ease
Or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy
We're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine
Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
That's what we call 'em pigsties for
They're like eyesores to police
Talk to you like just a piece of trash
Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in
To the sixties, having black skin is risky
'Cause this keeps happening
Throughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shit
And I admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a...

[Chorus: Eminem & Cheech and Chong]
White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
The world's coming to an end, I don't even care
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar

Pt. II

[Verse 3]
Seems like the average lifespan of a white man
Is more than twice than a black life span
I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
I feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstance
I'd rather hear 'em say "Die N-word" than Die Antwoord
Ninja, now it's better disguised banter
But that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financially
And can't find answers
We're applying, but McDonald's
Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
So how can we have higher standards?
As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
We fight back with violence but acts like that are
Black eyes on the movement
Which makes black lives madder
At cops and cops madder
That's why it's at a stalemate
And can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops
I wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops
The block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot
Call the attack dogs off of us, man
You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
And bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop
Sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods
Who ain't acclimated to 'em, like that's the way to do it
Who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns
And know nobody black so they act afraid of us
And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em
A subconscious racist
Wait, why are there black neighborhoods?
'Cause America segregated us, designated us to an area
Separated us, Section-Eight'd us
When we tear it up s the only time attention s paid to us
And education sucks, and every day's another
Freddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz
Why is it they treat us like dryer lint?
We just want a safe environment for our kids
But can t escape the sirens
Don t take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
The poverty that we face so the crime rate s the highest in
The lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence
And we re trapped in these racial biases
That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
Every time we see a devil s face
Lions, tigers, and bears, oh my
It's more like billy clubs and gats
And we really love it when you think we re guilty  cause we re black
"But you kill each other, facts
You peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats 
Single mother strugglin  through substance abuse
While people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes
Fuck your Republican views
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?
And streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics
Or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black
You better be strapped with a derringer
Or be  capped in America  like Steve Rogers
'Cause no one oversees these cops and
All we see is 'em beat charges
We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious, and got off
So we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings
Just keep marchin', 'til we reach congress
But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
If you try to slander the flag but
Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
If you don't stand for the national anthem
We raise it, you better praise it
Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll
Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
Home of the brave is still racist 'ville
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals
That had its Natives killed
Got you singin' this star-spangled spiel
To a piece of cloth that represents the "Land of the Free" that made people slaves to build

Southside
Pull up and wreck (yeah), pull up and
If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you

Pull up with the spark, hit you in the dark (whoa)
Tear your ass apart when you swim with sharks

Doing 106 then park like I'm in my yard (Sideways)
And motherfuck the camera time, I need family time (yeah)
I need "go see Uncle John in Atlanta" time (John)
I'd probably never get it, but it's cool to fantasize (it's cool)
Just like I do by old girl and these hands of mine (whoa)
Gripping on the titties, ass, and her thighs (oh yeah)
Honestly, I'm over her and her lies
Cartier over my eyes while I analyze
Ok, me and Lil Metro, rockin' new retros

Too blessed to stress, that's my manifesto (bless)
Fuck the professor, I'm too professional

Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
Pull up and wreck, we take no disrespect (disrespect)

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
How a nigga changed and still stayed a hundred? (huh)
I ran towards change while y'all ran from it (whoa)
Y'all wanna ball, I'm Stan Van Gundy
She wanna hang with me and 'Ye, she know that's good company
I like my skies Carolina blue and white
True one, false move and that could paralyze your life (brr)
So understand, I'm the overanalyzing type (type)
Panoramic views while I'm panning out my life (look up, look up)
And I grew up playing GoldenEye (damn)
So I'm used to sticking to the mission while they taking shots
When you this high, you disconnect a lot (yeah)
Sometimes I separate myself to connect the dots (I do)
Only way I'm going back is going back home (home)
I don't drink tap water, but got tapped phones (brr)
Dior on my suit, I'm the troop
Money come around, I'm never out the loop (loop)
Kiss the bottom of my boot (yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I know some East Side niggas and they love to bang
Know some West Side niggas like to do the same thing
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
I know some East Side niggas and they love to bang
Know some West Side niggas like to do the same thing
Pull up and wreck, pull up and wreck
Pull up and wreck, we take no disrespect

Oh God, oh my God

Believe by Eminem

[Verse 1]
And I started from the bottom
Like a snowman ground-up
Like round chuck, and still put hands on you
Stayin' wound up is how I spend time (Get it?)
Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes
I just got that air about me like wind chimes (Yeah)
'Nother day in the life (Uh)
Used to have to scrape to get by (Yeah)
Now my community's gated and I
Made it and my neighbors say hi (Say hi)
I'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now
Guess it means I'm way in the sky (Way in the sky)
But I still remember the days of
Minimum wage for general labor
Welfare recipient since a minor
Look how government assistance has made ya!
Adversity, if at first you don't succeed
Put your temper to more use
'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse
That should only give you more fuel
Show 'em why you're you
So close, God, it's like I almost got it
But close only counts in time, bombs and horseshoes
So I Unabomb shit tick, tick, tick no remorse, pew!
Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on WIC wick, wick, wick with a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 2]
Man, I know sometimes
These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me they're just ink blots
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise
So you might wanna think it over twice (Yeah)
Or you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger's free as a bird
Nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on Earth
Too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned
How to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America
Stick a fork in and turn
'Cause four-letter words are more better heard
The world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it
I was there consolin' you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of the tunnel
So people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear
Shit becomes too much to bear
Since "Cleanin' Out My Closet"
When I was havin' trouble with the snare
I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
And I'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh
When you struggle with despair
That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair
Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your 'fuck it' switch, nothin' can compare

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 3]
Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my pack
And I know that I always got Proof at my back
I called you "Proof" because I knew for a fact
My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you
'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so
Give me that inkling and mo 
 tivation to go, Hussein with the flow
Fake fans that are two-faced didn't show
Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul
Layin' vocals two days in a row
True statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose change
'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll
But it's never too late to start a new beginnin'
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?
Use the tools you're given!
Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?
I used to play the loser/victim
'Til I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days
That dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I'd run in place
While this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace
And the hunger pangs once you've won the race?
When that dual exhaust is coolin' off
'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'Cause you done already hit 'em
Still you feel the need to go full tilt
That Bruce Willis, that Blue Steel, that true skill
When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will
Do you still believe?

Like Home (feat. Alicia Keys) by Eminem

[Intro]
Yeah, shout to everybody
Who's been on this trip with me
You don't have to, agree
But if you feel like me

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Someone get this Aryan a sheet
Time to bury him, so tell him to prepare to get impeached
Everybody on your feet
This is where terrorism and heroism meet, square off in the street
This chump barely even sleeps
All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats
While he looks like a canary with a beak
Why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet? He's tryin' to divide us
This shit's like a cult, but like Johnny he'll only unite us
'Cause nothin' inside us drives us like this fight does
Similar to when two cars collide 'cause
Our spirit's crushed, and this spot's a tight one
But here the jaws of life come
To pull us from the wreckage, that's what we get pride from
When we can t from our stars and stripes cause
This type of pickle that we're in is hard to deal
But there's always tomorrow still
If we start from scratch like a scab, get the scars to heal
And band together for Charlottesville
And for Heather, fallen heroes, fill this wall with murals
Nevada get up, hit the damn resetter
Let's start from zero, this is our renewal
Spray tan, get rid of, get a brand new, better
America, and here's to where it all

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Eminem]
And here's to where we all began, all began (Stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (Hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
For the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya?
Can't denounce the Klan, 'cause they play golf with ya
You stay on Twitter, way to get your hate off
Nazi, I do not see a way y'all differ
And all you got are race cards, bigot
The swastika with your name carved in it
Should be your trademark, 'cause hate's all you played off
And you just lick the plate off
So I guess it pays to feed off of chaos
So basically, you ate off Hitler!
But you ain't ruinin' our country, punk
Or takin' our pride from us, you won't define us
'Cause like a dictionary, things are lookin' up
So much, got a sprained neck, know we would rise up
Against this train wreck and take a stand
Even if it means sittin' when they raise the flag
To sing "The Star-Spangled Banner"
This man just praised a statue of General Lee
'Cause he generally hates the black people, degrades hispanics
Take it back to the Shady national convention
Wish I woulda spit on it before I went to shake his hand
At the event or maybe had the wherewithal
To know that he was gonna try to tear apart
Our sacred land we cherish and stand for
So, hands in the air, let's hear it for
The start of a brand new America
Without him and be proud of where we're from
And here's to where we all

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Eminem]
And here's to where we all began, all began (Stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (Hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
For the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

[Bridge: Alicia Keys & Eminem]
I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know that I won't give up
I won't give up on my home, that so many died for
You already know
There's no place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go, no place like home
No place like home, no place like home
Wherever I go (Yeah)

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Eminem]
And here's to where we all began, all began (Stand up!)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (Hands up!)
Here's to the land that raised me
This one for the only place that really knows me
For the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home

Remind Me by Eminem

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yo! I bust in, devilish grin, disgustin'
Asshole, freckled cheeks and a butt-chin
Callin' all party animals, get
On the floor when I pop up on some Whac-A-Mole shit
In search of a chick who's stacked and so thick
And implants are so big
She can hang me up on that rack, big ol' tits
Like Anna Nicole Smith
Body's bananas and sass to go with
I spot you at first glance and go "shit!"
You wearin' those pants that don't fit
That butt won't ever give up
That's why you stick it out no matter what, huh?
'Cause you got an ass that won't quit
So, get on the horn, my saxophone
Grab hold of my instrument, get a grasp, and blow "whee"
You just laugh and go heehee
'Cause you're just as nasty so that's appropriate
That's why 

[Chorus: Eminem / Joan Jett & the Blackhearts]
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (Yeah, me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (Yeah, me)

[Interlude: Eminem]
You know, I'm wearin' a new shirt tonight too
With me on it

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm lookin' at your tight rear like a sightseer
Your booty is heavy duty like diarrhea
The plan's to bring you to my house
You're drinkin' Jack and Beam
I'm thinkin' soon this tramp'll lean so we should bounce
But you're outta your tube-top
If you're thinkin' that mi casa es su casa
Yeah, you're a cute fox
Perfect ten so back that up like a moonwalk
Girl, you're smokin' like Snoop Dogg
But you must be tokin' if you think you're takin' over my quarters
There goes the dime into the jukebox
Two shots of blue Hpnotiq and soon I'll
Turn this pool hall to a barroom brawl
So, Rick, scratch on the break like the cue ball
Turn the volume all the way up on your boombox
And excuse the locker room talk, I'm just too raw
But apparently, so are you, ma
'Cause you just kicked me in the balls and told me to screw off
And that's why 

[Chorus: Eminem / Joan Jett & the Blackhearts]
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (Yeah, me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (Yeah, me)

[Bridge: Eminem & Joan Jett & The Blackhearts]
Said "Can I take you home, where we can be alone?"
Shorty, you the shit, girl, I ordered you to sit
I know you're probably feelin' me more than you admit
Pull up a chair, sweetie, let me order you a drink
I only go to meetings court-ordered from a shrink
So from the bottom to the top, floor to ceilin'
You ain't run of the mill, you're one in a million
'Cause real tits are still fun
But everybody knows fake tits are still better than real ones

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So come and spend the night with the guy most are terrified of
But tonight, curiosity overrides ya
Beside ya fired up like a starter pistol
Crystal, let's slide hon, tonight I'm your pilot
'Cause you should be up in the sky, girl
You're so fucking fly, you belong in the mile high club
So come on, baby, the night's young
Don't string me along, I'm high-strung
We might wind up on mound like we're tryin' for the Cy Young
Fuckin' 'fore we get to the house
Screwin' our brains out like changing a lightbulb
That's why I like ya, 'cause I'm crazy just like ya
Now every time I get brain, you screw mine up
I barely can think straight, your head game is a mindfuck
So ready, set, aim and fire
Yes, babe, I m fallin' in like, that's kinda, why I love

[Chorus: Eminem / Joan Jett & the Blackhearts]
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (Yeah me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (Yeah, me)

Bad Husband (feat. X Ambassadors) by Eminem

[Verse 1: Eminem]
We never saw from each other's sides, or eye to eye
Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight
So much baggage, need a luggage rack
But we carry on with our public spats and our feuds
Up back in the news, love taps when I dissed you
Like it was fun, actually used to run back to the booth
Jump back in the studio, give you a tongue-lashing, then you
Laughed at the stomach tat with the tombstone
It was funny back in our youth
But then it wasn t after we knew
That we were done and actually through (And actually through)
But if there's one fraction of truth
If it could be spun back I would do
So many things different (Things different)
'Cause it was such a dumbass excuse
You hit me once and that I would use
To continue the pattern of abuse
Why did I punch back? Girls, your dad is a scumbag, I m confused
Because 

[Chorus: X Ambassadors]
How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You were the beat I loved with a writer's block
The line that's hot, that I forgot
We laughed a little, cried a lot
I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie
Day before you went to jail and daily
How we'd wait for that mail lady
Or by the phone for Mom to call
And I watched you pull yourself up and we decided on
Givin' it one more try despite it all
You're my lightning rod when my sky gets dark
I'm your shiny rocks in that tiny box
When we tied the knot, when we broke the knot
Every line we crossed we were supposed to not
Every time we fought, the insults they got  thrown too far
Words that we said that we didn t mean
The words that we meant that we didn t say
The ones that we thought that we shoulda said
Letters written that we coulda read
Which maybe woulda lead to some good instead
And had this put to bed
But I'd be lyin  still if I said I wasn't sittin' here askin' myself

[Chorus: X Ambassadors, Hailie Jade & Eminem]
How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband (Dad) (You said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there s always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband

[Verse 3: Eminem]
We brought out the worst in each other
Someone had to make the sparring end
'Cause I loved you, but I hated that me
And I don't wanna see that side again
But I'm sorry, Kim
More than you could ever comprehend
Leavin' you was fuckin' harder than
Sawing off a fuckin' body limb
Once upon a time we're all we had
Maybe that's what drew us
To each other, it was true love
Shit, we never knew was possible
We might have loved each other too much
And maybe that's what made us do what
We did to each other, all the screw-ups
'Cause you always thought that you was
More in love with me
And I was thinkin' I was more in love than you was
For all the times that we thought it worked
'Til we saw how wrong we were
When the dust settles now and all the dirt
If I touch the rawest nerve
All I want is for us not to hurt
And it's been an exhaustive search to find the words
But I just heard "Mockingbird"
And got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts
The purpose was not to stir up or open wounds
I've caused a few and so have you
Or argue whose fault it was
Partly yours, partly mine, but really no one's
This is so tough, I'm gettin' choked up
Oh fuck it, we both suck
We broke up, got back together
We both thought we had forever
Not bad people, just bad together
We were so nuts, backstabbed each other
Another blow struck, but there's no duckin' this blow
'Cause it's over and it's closure
But I'm not so sure how to close this
I just don't know how some people can be so good
At one thing and so fucked at a whole nother
Shit, it's no wonder

[Chorus: X Ambassadors, Hailie Jade, Eminem]
How come, how come, you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband (Dad) (You said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband

Untouchable by Eminem

Pt. I

[Intro]
Hands up, officer don t shoot
Then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot
We may never understand each other, it s no use
We ain t ever gonna grasp what each other goes through

[Verse 1]
Black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you
Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you
Pull up on the side of you
Window rolled down, 'profile'
Then we wonder why we see this side of you
Probably comin' from the dope house
We could let you slide but your tail light is blew, out
We know you're hidin' that Heidi Klum
On you another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you
And just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true
Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it
In your back, then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
Fucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?
I keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'
No matter how many lives you ruin
It's for the red, white and blue
Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
No one's ever indicted you
Why? 'Cause you're a...

[Chorus: Eminem & Cheech and Chong]
White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
The world's coming to an end, I don't even care
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar

[Verse 2]
Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man
Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
Balderdash, where d you get the chip on your shoulder at?
Why you kicking that soda can?
Pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and
Throw your ass in the van cuffed
You don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are
Our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands
And put our minds more at ease
Or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy
We're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine
Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
That's what we call 'em pigsties for
They're like eyesores to police
Talk to you like just a piece of trash
Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in
To the sixties, having black skin is risky
'Cause this keeps happening
Throughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shit
And I admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a...

[Chorus: Eminem & Cheech and Chong]
White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar
My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
But I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
The world's coming to an end, I don't even care
Nobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar

Pt. II

[Verse 3]
Seems like the average lifespan of a white man
Is more than twice than a black life span
I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
I feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstance
I'd rather hear 'em say "Die N-word" than Die Antwoord
Ninja, now it's better disguised banter
But that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financially
And can't find answers
We're applying, but McDonald's
Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
So how can we have higher standards?
As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
We fight back with violence but acts like that are
Black eyes on the movement
Which makes black lives madder
At cops and cops madder
That's why it's at a stalemate
And can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops
I wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops
The block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot
Call the attack dogs off of us, man
You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
And bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop
Sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods
Who ain't acclimated to 'em, like that's the way to do it
Who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns
And know nobody black so they act afraid of us
And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em
A subconscious racist
Wait, why are there black neighborhoods?
'Cause America segregated us, designated us to an area
Separated us, Section-Eight'd us
When we tear it up s the only time attention s paid to us
And education sucks, and every day's another
Freddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz
Why is it they treat us like dryer lint?
We just want a safe environment for our kids
But can t escape the sirens
Don t take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
The poverty that we face so the crime rate s the highest in
The lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence
And we re trapped in these racial biases
That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
Every time we see a devil s face
Lions, tigers, and bears, oh my
It's more like billy clubs and gats
And we really love it when you think we re guilty  cause we re black
"But you kill each other, facts
You peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats 
Single mother strugglin  through substance abuse
While people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes
Fuck your Republican views
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?
And streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics
Or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black
You better be strapped with a derringer
Or be  capped in America  like Steve Rogers
'Cause no one oversees these cops and
All we see is 'em beat charges
We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious, and got off
So we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings
Just keep marchin', 'til we reach congress
But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
If you try to slander the flag but
Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
If you don't stand for the national anthem
We raise it, you better praise it
Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll
Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
Home of the brave is still racist 'ville
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals
That had its Natives killed
Got you singin' this star-spangled spiel
To a piece of cloth that represents the "Land of the Free" that made people slaves to build

Tragic Endings (feat. Skylar Grey) by Eminem

[Verse 1: Skylar Grey]
I'm stumbling, I can t see straight
And it's my fault I got this way
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to mess it up
I did my best, I tried to change
But it's just in my DNA
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to fuck it up again

[Refrain: Skylar Grey]
Now I m the one thing you couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing that I would die for

[Verse 2: Eminem]
All my life, I was told, I was never nothing special
I don't need to be reminded of it every other second
'Specially when all my self-esteem's
Already shot to hell, I'm falling helplessly
I'm embarrased, I don t want no one else to see
 Cause I feel like I'm a piece of shit every time she yells at me
Selfishly addicted, definitely doesn t help that she
Makes me feel like I've died and gone to heaven
But makes life a living hell for me
She does that thing with her lip, now she's melting me
I'm putty in her palms, I m wrapped around her finger
A yo-yo on a string, she lets me sit there and just dangle
Until something better comes along
And she'll just drop me like a hot potato
I look like I'm in pain, but I'm okay though
'Cause I know she loves me my friends, what do they know?

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
(Drunk off tragic endings)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
In my moments of weakness
I openly admit the shit I wouldn't normally
I'm extremely self-conscious and enormously
Insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me
It only turns to ammunition for her in this war, when she
Gets goin' she don't stop, when I'm up she's like a downer
When I found her it was love at first encounter
But, somehow she musta took the carton of eggs off the counter
Cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground for
Me to walk on when I'm around her
But there's just something about her
That makes me not able to function without her
How can I get out of it when I don't know how to?
I'm a doubter, I'm a pessimist, make a believer out of me
And show me the way now or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain
'Cause I'm going straight down the drain, I'm drowning

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
(Drunk off tragic endings)

[Refrain: Skylar Grey]
Now I'm the one thing you couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing that I would die for

[Verse 4: Eminem]
It took a while for me to get it, but I think I've figured it out
She don't want me, she just don't wanna see me with someone else
The idea of seeing me happy destroys her in itself
To see me falling to pieces brings her joy and brings her health
But it annoys her to see me get the strength to say, "Screw her!"
I threw up on myself, I'm dumb sick, I'm addicted to her
She's tryna block the door, so here's how I do her
Since I'm manure, she's a sewer
And this time this piece of shit's running through her
I can see the light, now I'm running to it
What the fuck? Shoulda knew it!
Who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?
As soon as I hopped in it, she doused the car with lighter fluid
She's standing there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it
Lit the fucking thing on fire, then she threw it

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there, but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
(Drunk off tragic endings)

Chloraseptic (feat. Phresher) by Eminem

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Instinctive nature to bring the anguish (Yeah)
To the English language
With this ink, you haters get rode on like a piece of paper
This rap shit got me travelin' place to place
You barely leave your house
'Cause you're always stuck at your pad, it's stationary
Yeah, that's why when I brainstorm, gotta write it out
Simon Cowell of rhymin' foul, that's why you sound so shook
Wire bound notebook got tied around your throat
Hook it inside your mouth, go hruh
That's what it's like when the mic is out
'Cause I'm tearin' at your flesh with it
'Til your larynx and neck are split
With these lyrics, weapons, expert with
Like hair extensions, extra clips
And you're scared to effin' death of it
Bitch, you're starin' at a legend that
In a pair of Skechers, sweatshirt ripped
And hoodie black, should be strapped
To a chair or stretcher, electric, swear on every record, bitch
Finger so high in the air, I'll bet your senses flip
Like a barometric pressure switch
Carin' less who I offend with this
I'm at your neck like Pez dispense
Go 'head, spit your flow, bitch!

[Chorus: PHresher]
I'm at your throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with it, 'plex with it
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Eminem & PHresher]
And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew, somethin' to chew

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Yeah, uh (Haha), and still conjoined at
The hip with hop, still on point and poignant
Skilled as Floyd is
In this field, and still no filter, boy
I'll put you in your place (Yeah) like a realtor, boy
You still ain't in the buildin', boy
I will destroy shit, even as I build it
Get the drill bit, pen is filled with poison
Which is the source, easy to still pinpoint it
(Like what?) Like a real thin joint it
(What?) Comes on Quilted Northern
(And what?) In a built-in toilet
(Yeah) Bitch, I told you I'm a dog (Woof)
I wouldn't heal with ointment
Way I'm kickin' these fairies' tails
Should write a children's storybook (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Million voices in my head
But still get a little bit of thrill and some real enjoyment
(Off what?) Off the feel of going in
(Like?) Like your bitch when she gives me brain
Like she thinks I'm dumb
Grabs the crown of my dick and blows me to kingdom come
'Til I feel anointed
She makes iller noises
When she's with me, must be from the Windy City
Pretty apparent, she's a MILF when blowin' me
'Cause I conned her into
Rippin' the condom in two (Woo!)
Dick is a bargainin' tool
Now I'm gettin' blew like Klonopins, Rude Jude
I go there, you wouldn't
Well, I still have a few views in common with you
Just not YouTube, 'cause 

[Chorus: PHresher]
I'm at your throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with it, 'plex with it
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

[Verse 3: Eminem]
You're a has-been
That has been the case since back when
You last went and threw your hat in the race
You've been trash (Bitch!)
Stick your raps in the trash bin
Or end up in my next rhyme
You're a fuckboy, so next time
It's gonna be heads flyin' like Dez Bryant
With a TEC-9 against Rex Ryan (Yeah!)
Now watch me set it like correct time
All you get is sloppy seconds like a Timex, I
Clock rejects into the next life
Talking reckless, but it's just my
Strongest suit, but you can get my Colombian necktie
Prostitute, just climb in the Humvee and let's ride
Why you hitching at night?
I put an end to your life, sex crime
Kidding aside, insidious vibe
Girl, you know you got the prettiest eyes
But all you're getting is bribed
Any old lie to try to get you inside
Then we gon' end up spending the night
And I'm skinning your hide like an Indian tribe
What kind of nut drives a Budweiser truck
Finds a slut, tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her up
Binds up, cuts, slices her twice?
But the muff diver must just like it rough
Fuck right in her vagina, blood
Flies up on the visor, like a geyser, uh
(Music, please!) Enthusiast of the roofie
Goal is to get a floozy inside the Jacuzzi
And have a loosey-goosey as Cool C is with an Uzi
But I am to rap what blue jeans mean to Bruce Springsteen
Glued we be, I'm truTV, you're too PG
I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee!
No diss there, just notice there
Are no similarities that we share
Besides the fact we breathe air
Happily married to rap and I'm glad that we buried
The hatchet and patched it up
Now I'm back to ratchet up my attack
And I'm at your mothafuckin' throat like 

[Chorus: PHresher]
 throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with it, 'plex with it
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Eminem & PHresher]
And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose, what can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose
And all it wants is to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew, somethin' to chew

Nowhere Fast (feat. Kehlani) by Eminem

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Ashes blowin' in the air
Our world s on fire, but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we re never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold
Fuck doin' what you're told
We're goin' nowhere fast

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I feel sorry for this beat, sympathy pains for this track
This road is takin  me back
Down memory lane with this rap
I can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback
I m simply stating a fact
I had Wembley Stadium packed
But now we're on a path headed to nowhere and fast
Another terrorist attacks
Like a tariff, blows half of Madison Square up, alas
We perish in the blast
But that isn t scaring us, we pass
Nowhere we're fearless, 'cause we're just 

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani & Eminem]
Ashes blowin  in the air
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
(We don't give a  no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

[Post-Chorus: Kehlani]
'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no
Goin no, goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin' nowhere fast

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Fuck doin' what you're told, act like a two-year old
Shit is soon to go kaboom and blow
Anyways; for MC's it's a funeral
When I'm devisin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm awake and you're mourning
That's why I rise and I shine
Like a new day has dawned on me
Gusto, guts, bravado
Nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot
I musta got you in somewhat of a debacle
'Cause some stuff that's awful
Really don't mean nothin' although
There's a lot of shit I said in jest that's tough to swallow
But if at times my heart it seems
Like it's in the wrong place, it's probably 'cause it's on my sleeve
Keanu Reeves speed of life, avoid or veer
Or just steer toward it, we're only lookin' forward
But where we're goin', we have no idea
Nowhere to go, but hysterical, it's gettin' warm in here
I set the world on fire, was born to be an arsonist
Just one spark and it's lit
But I'ma still get dark on this shit
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch war machine
But you forced me in a corner
I'm sure to have somethin' for your rear
And in the course of the assault as torture gets more severe
Go to war with me, you'll end up blew to Timbuktu
I send at you a ten-ton nuke like Kim Jong-Un
And end up ruinin' your career
But when all is said and done
And at the end of my run I'll just rewind clocks, forever young
Make time stop, will I ever fall off? That day will never come
'Til the pine box, bitch, fuck you! I'm better than I ever was
'Til the bomb drops, hope it never does
But I'm not gonna sweat it 'cause
This world's screwed, it's already fucked
And I'm on top, so everyone's just 

[Chorus: Kehlani & Eminem]
Ashes blowin' in the air (so we're )
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
(We don't give a  no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

[Post-Chorus: Kehlani]
'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin' nowhere fast

[Bridge: Eminem & Kehlani]
You can't tell us nothin'
Hard-headed and we're stubborn
So, one ear and out the other when we're young, we're young
(We're on the run of our lives)
Who knows what the future for us could hold
Another shooter? Uh oh
(We're on the run of our lives)
No more tomorrows, we're done
And all we are is 

[Chorus: Kehlani & Eminem]
Ashes blowin' in the air (so we're )
Our world's on fire, but we don't care (don't care, yeah)
(We don't give a  no, no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin' back and we're never gettin' old
'Cause the skies are black
But our heart's made of gold (golden)
Fuck doin' what you're told (what we're told)
We're goin' nowhere fast

[Post-Chorus: Kehlani]
'Cause we're goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' no
Goin' no, goin' nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin' nowhere fast

Framed by Eminem

[Verse 1]
Feeling kinky, lip syncing to Too $hort's "Freaky Tales" (Biatch!)
Having creepy visions of whiskey drinking
And envisioning sneaking into where Christie Brinkley dwells
I know this is risky thinking but I wanna stick her like she's decals
But when murdering females
Better pay attention to these details or you could be derailed
Better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail
If you get scratched because your DNA'll
Be all up under her fingernails
Man, he hears you, I don't think he cares
He gives a fuck, even his pinky swears
Three personalities burstin' out of me, please beware
Her TV blares, can't hear the creaking stairs
She's unaware in no underwear, she's completely bare
Turns around and screams, I remember distinctly
I said "I'm here to do sink repairs."
Chop her up, put her body parts
In front of Steven Avery's trailer and leave 'em there

[Chorus]
But hey man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what? He's
Got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

[Verse 2]
Woke up, it was dawn, musta knew somethin' was wrong
Think I'm becomin' a monster 'cause of the drugs that I'm on
Donald Duck's on, there's a Tonka Truck in the yard
But dog, how the fuck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car?
Gotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it
Must go above and beyond, 'cause it's incumbent upon me
Plus I feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde
Girl, that motherfuckin' baton twirler that got dumped in the pond
Second murder with no recollection of it
Collectin' newspaper articles, cuttin' out sections from it
Memory's too fucked to remember, destructive temper
Cut my public defender's jugular then stuck him up in a blender
Another dismembered toddler discovered this winter probably
'Cause the disassembled body
Was covered up in the snow since the month of November oddly
I'm wanted for questioning
Them son of a bitches probably just wanna pin this on me

[Chorus]
But hey man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what? He's
Got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

[Verse 3]
Still on the loose, they
Spotted me inside McDonald's Tuesday
In a Toronto Blue Jays cap, lookin' like your college roommate
With Rihanna, Lupe, Saddam Hussein, Bobby Boucher
Or was it Cool J? The cops is on a goose chase
Just escaped from the state pen
For [edited] eight women who hate men
Don't make it no weirder, I'm naked
When I break in your basement
Under your baby's play pen, I lay in, wait adjacent
Facin' the door, remainin' patient while stayin' complacent
Blatant sexual implications are continuin' to get thrown
Insinuations are placed in little riddles and poems
Left on your pillow in hopes, that when you get home
You'll get the hint, ho: I'm in your window
But it never occurred to me I could describe a murder scene
In a verse and be charged with first degree
'Cause it just happened to match up perfectly
With the massacre or the Burger King burglary
No, officer, you see ...

[Chorus]
I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what? He's
Got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

Revival (Interlude) by Eminem

[Verse: Alice and the Glass Lake]
I've drowned in high from the ashes
Now I can't recall your laughter
The smoke of everything go grasp
At ends of what's left over
And the lights in every broken
Blown-out window screaming, laughing
I hope to feel it coursing out
This is our revival

In Your Head by Eminem

[Intro: The Cranberries]
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm packin' up my shit, as much shit in the car as I can fit
And I'm just drivin' as far as I can get
Away from these problems 'til all of my sorrows I forget
What's tomorrow like? 'Cause tonight I'm startin' life again
Get to the corner and stop, fuck am I goin'?
Besides psycho when I fantasize startin' my whole life over
Yeah right, oh and I might go and
Get hypnotized so I don't even recognize no one
I try to look alive but there's nothin' like holdin'
Your head up high when you're dead inside and I just hide, so in
Case you're wonderin' why are my insides showin'
'Cause I done spilled all my guts and those are mine, so I'm
Pickin' 'em up and stuffin' 'em back
Fuck it, I've done enough in this rap shit
Recovery brought me nothin' but back
To right where I was and perhaps
This coulda been my victory lap, if I wasn't on the verge of relapse

[Chorus: The Cranberries]
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It seems to be the reoccurring main theme
The shit I would daydream as a kid, I was eighteen
I went from an irate teenager to still raging
As an adult, amazing: back then I put anything
Into the rhyme, whether it was sad, mad, happy or angry
I spit it, the mainstream, I hit it
Yay me, I did it!  Did what?
Hailie, baby, I didn't mean to make you eighty
Percent of what I rapped about
Maybe I shoulda did a better job at separating
Shady and entertaining from real life
But this fame thing is still the hardest thing to explain
It's the craziest shit I
Ever seen, and back then it was like I ain't even
Bothered taking into consideration
You one day being older and may hear me say things
I didn t (A) mean and (B) just ain t me
Okay, so ladies and gentlemen
Let's strip away everything and see the main reason that I
Feel like a lame piece of shit, I sound cranky and bitter
Complain, beef and bicker 'bout the same things
'Cause when I look at me, I don't see what they see
I feel ashamed, greedy
And lately I've been contemplating
Escaping to get away and go wherever this road takes me
It's making me crazy, what's in my 

[Chorus: The Cranberries]
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

Offended by Eminem

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You claim if you get knocked by the cops
You'll give 'em not even a statement
Walk in the arraignment
Shoot the bailiff, karate kick the plaintiff
Gotti with the stainless
I'll just call it shoddy entertainment
If y'all was in the party gettin' faded
On molly, had the audience sedated
You wouldn't catch a body if it fainted
Probably let it fall and hit the pavement
But you'd be the first lobbyin' to claim it
Bitch, stop bein' a lame
Your hobby isn t robbery and dismemberin' body limbs
Like you was Tommy Lynn Sells
And chainsawin' them in the basement
Hardly fits your job description
Ain't nobody dippin'
Out the back of the club like, "Oh my God, he's trippin'!"
Only time you get the blade is probably with the dang lawn equipment, ain't it?
Wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave it
I need to stop bein' debated
You're still copyin', Xeroxing, I'm still coppin' a feel
Like Bill Cosby at will, poppin' a pill
Then spill Oxys in Jill's coffee
Then send her out to the hotel lobby a lil' wobbly and still groggy
This blonde fuck's reprehensible
Misconducts, never sensible
Kiss my butt, my set of principles
Is gone, but 'til I get the President to respond
My pen and pencil is a missile launcher
And send it to Mitch McConnell
Just as big of a bitch as Donald shit's on, bruh! (Ha-ha)
Let me sing this shit soprano
While I do it pizzicato
Ivanka, stiff-arm her while I'm hittin' on Melania
And this song's for all ya

[Chorus: Eminem & Kent Jones]
'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds

[Verse 2: Eminem & Paul Rosenberg]
These drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me
Like Justin Ross Harris at a nursery
Goin' ham at candy yam on nanny cam
I'm gettin' handies with the zanny Xannys in the Caddy armrest
I'm imaginin' objects
So I'm battin' cobwebs from a daddy longleg
In Hamtramck, got the panoramic camera
Xanax, a banana hammock and a Santa hat
I'm smellin' like a damn mechanic
With a chick that looks like Janet Jackson with a Spanish accent
Twice her age and I'm actin' half it (Ha-ha)
Grow up? Nah, not that I know of, y'all
Basement just got a frickin' overhaul
Got a stripper pole installed
Started rollin' all through those Klonopins like a bowlin' ball
Like an overdose on twice the ratio of Propofol
And go through no withdrawal
While I get fellatio and give a facial to
An interracial blow-up doll of Rachel Dolezal
You're so appalled (Em ), so's my manager
Bitch, I am mature, fuck a pro career
Coast is clear, but nowhere to go from here
And nobody's close so don't compare
They ain't nowhere near, I'm way over here
My competition can't see me 'cause I don't own a mirror!
But, Marshall, you are terrific, so smart and gifted
I'm so narcissistic, when I fart I sniff it
Do a fake dab to smell my armpits, whiff it
Your anxiety's throwin' gang signs
But I made strides with these rape lines
I'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes
Like Ray Rice when he FaceTimes
Bang, bang, bang, bang time
Dang knives're butcher than gay wives
You're gonna need sutures the same size
As the blade I push into caput'cha
When I pull 'em like (What?) sleigh rides
Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times to make it on Dateline
I came to stake my claim like a canine waitin' in a buffet line
So, Kellyanne Conway, I'm a really bad hombre
Come play, belly dance on me
I've been makin' wedding plans all day

[Chorus: Eminem & Kent Jones]
'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Eight-year-old with the wordplay
Girl, take this pole like a survey
Today wasn't my birthday
But I'm caked up like a dessert tray
So we're in shape, 'cause you're in a slurrin' state
I m a ten, you re an eight
Like what I do before, after, and durin' rape!
You wanna get into a pissin' contest and find out who's better?
And be made a fool out of when I pull on 'em?
R. Kelly with a full bladder
Non-high school grad, I'm not a scholar
But I'm so cold when I'm droppin' knowledge
My degrees is the same as I got in college (Zero)
But nobody's hotter, you owe me my respect
I owe you nada like Haloti, partner
Blow me, told you I'm so dirty, homie
You can throw me in some holy water
With some floaties on and get the soap and try to
Get the Pope to hold me while you hose me off
And nope, I won't be washed
Hope to God I don't explode
I gotta blow this spot up though, I got a lotta mo'
I won't put the sugar coating on it though
'Cause sometimes you can feel like your energy's expired
Rap's got you drained, dead tired, zapped
You feel like a wet pile of crap
But look, man, like the feds buggin' my phone (Uh-huh)
I get why you're tapped
"But you gotta get your fire back
Catch fire, get upset and fire back!"
Is what I tell myself when times get bad
'Cause sometimes I might get sad
But I take the same advice I had
And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie when life's a drag
Told her to do like her dad: don't cry, get mad!
'Cause little baby powders belong in diaper bags
I'm hyper, by the time you see this side of me
I'm right in your ass (Sodomy!)
Foot up it, I stood up for the kid
Who had to put up with the bullies at his school (At his school)
You ain't had to have no money
Or go shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitude (Attitude)
Now my dough's amountin' to a mountain
That's rised too high to count it
Never asked to be rich, all I did was wish
I had a dime for every time that I was doubted
But then I think about it, then I'm enraged
'Cause I just figured out that if I was paid
For the time I spent to put the pen to the page
It'd be minimum wage
But it's embedded in my head I never
Hunted for the bread and butter
What I wanted was to be the one that they was scared of but
I'm never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood
I put up in the pen, and when I'm dead I wonder
Will they put me on a pedestal
Or forget I was ever this incredible?
I guess I better go harder than ever 'cause
I'll never get another motherfuckin' opportunity again
To offend as many people with this, I can simply because I can

[Chorus: Eminem & Kent Jones]
'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms (I hope you offended)
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words (I hope you offended)
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse (I hope you offended)
'Cause I swear when I get up, I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds

Need Me (feat. Pink) by Eminem

[Verse 1: P!nk]
You're drunk, the carpet is burned
I hate to find you like this
I always find you like this
I come home and clean up your mess
What would you do without that?
Why do I always come back?
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you!

[Chorus: P!nk]
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

[Verse 2: P!nk & Eminem]
Some nights I want to run for the hills
It's never easy with you
I cannot reason with you
But your smile is as rare as it comes
What would I do without that?
Maybe that's why I come back
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you!

[Chorus: P!nk]
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Startin' to think we were made for each other
But one of us in this relationship is raisin' the other
You remind me of my mother
We drive one another crazy as each other
And we're both adults, so there's no excuse
For the games that we play with each other
Where you at? At a friend's? No, you ain't, mothafucker!
But I give her the benefit of the doubt
Whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver when I touch her
'Cause I love her so much, I'm a sucker
How her bottom lip can quiver when she's in trouble
She's in hot water, think I caught her cheatin' again
Give her another chance? Another one after that?
I'm swimmin' in that Egyptian river, 'cause I'm in denial
Say I don't eat shit, but I got a shit-eatin' grin when I smile
Makin' an excuse for us to act it out
She's just actin' out with her inner child
Then I set the truth on fire
'Cause I'd rather believe a lie
Then I breathe a sigh of relief, I don't believe in
Goin' to bed mad, I keep on tryin'
To make a bad girl good
But haven't I stood by you in good times?
And bad? I'm startin' to feel like your goddamn dad
'Cause I literally feel like you could die if ever should I
Leave you for good and never would I
It'd be all bad, never understood why they call it goodbye
But I think I'm a pretty damn good guy
And you're a good person too
I can save you, I can make you change
But I keep puttin' my fuckin' foot in my mouth
Every time I gotta come and bail you out
When you get in trouble that you get yourself in
And I'm in trouble, but I can't leave, I'll sell you out
I could never turn my fuckin' back on you what is that?
I'm co-dependent, I'm just now noticin' it
But somehow it's like every time I'm about to go to end it
I ain't got the cojones to do it, nor the heart
Our apartment's tore apart
You're usin' my heart for a dartboard
But God must've aligned stars for us
'Cause somebody paired us up
And they say He ain't capable of makin' a mistake
But this one's perfect, 'cause I'm 

[Chorus: P!nk]
I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm startin' to think that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me

Castle by Eminem

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues and Eminem]
I built this castle
Now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry we re alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you ll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever
December 1st, 1995, dear Hailie
This is your song

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You'll be coming out of Mommy's stomach soon
I better do something quick if I'ma be able to support you
I can barely support me, but as long as you're healthy
That's all that matters for the time being
But obviously assuming you will be
Just thinking ahead, I ma make it if it kills me
Let s see how far I can take it with this music
I'm getting sick of chasing this illusion (ha!)
Sorry for sloppy writing
The pen in my hand is shaking, please excuse me
Dad s a little nervous, but at the same time excited
If I use this same energy while I'm saying rhymes and write them
With the same passion and the same exact enthusiasm
As I'm using in this letter, maybe they can feel me as I'm
Trying to build these castles out of sand, baby girl
For you to sit on the throne, I got plans, baby girl
Welcome to Mom and Dad s crazy world
Love, Daddy, maple-flavored kisses, buttered pancakes, and syrup

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues and Eminem]
I built this castle
Now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever
December 1st, 1996, dear Hailie

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You got your momma's personality, same eyes as I got
Her beautiful smile, but your ears are the same size as mine are
Sorry for that, a little minor mishap
But you'll grow into them, baby, I'm on the grind now
I'm doing little shows, open mics, all-nighters at studios
While I'm tryna keep the lights on
Why does it seem like I'm so close to this dream, yet so far?
I just keep steering, I'ma turn into someone
I haven't the slightest clue what I'ma do if it falls through
You took your first steps today, you'll probably walk soon
My Infinite CD flopped, too many soft tunes
They're talking bad about Dad, it's ticking me off too
Makes me feel like I don't belong or something, ooh
I think I might have just stumbled onto something new
Got a prediction for the future, I'm hoping that you
Open this envelope when you're older and it holds true

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues and Eminem]
I built this castle
Now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever
December 24th, 2007, dear Hailie

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now if you found these letters, I guess I better try to explain
A lot's happened in between them since I rised to this fame
I've said your name but always tried to hide your face
This game is crazy, I wanted to claim my love for you, but dang
I never knew it'd be like this, if I did I wouldn't have done it
You ain't asked for none of this shit, now you're being punished?!
Things that should've been private with me and your mother is public
I can't stomach, they can take this fame back, I don't want it
I'll put out this last album then I'm done with it
One-hundred percent finished
Fed up with it, I'm hanging it up, fuck it
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen, don't take this letter I wrote
As a goodbye note, but your dad's at the end of his rope
I'm sliding down a slippery slope
Anyways sweetie, I better go
I'm getting sleepy, love, Dad  shit, I don't know

Heat by Eminem

[Intro: John C. Reilly]
Wanna take it from the top?

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Lady, you remind me of my raps on that Relapse shit
'Cause you got an ass thick as them accents
Two ass-cheek implants, call that an asset
'Cause you could set a glass on it, it's massive
From the first time I saw you, I actually
Said to myself: "I gotta meet her" like a taxi
Exactly, love affair in the backseat
Sorry if I'm being graphic
But I'm stiff as a statue you sat on a shelf
I feel like I'ma bust, maybe I'm just ahead of myself
Let me slow down, slow your Camaro
I'm tryna catch up, I'm tryna jump your bones to the marrow
Got me under your control and your spell
Wanna wrap you up, put you in a bow like an arrow
Grab you by the (Meow!), hope it's not a problem, in fact
About the only thing I agree on with Donald is that
So when I put this palm on your cat
Don't snap, it's supposed to get grabbed
Why you think they call it a snatch?
I just wanna climb in the sack
I'ma keep it a hundred like my speedometer's at
I'm watchin' you rap, I'm the dude followin' back
About six cars, I'm in the 'lac, and I wanna fack

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I want it 

[Chorus: Mark Wahlberg (& John C. Reilly)]
All day, all night
You feel, my heat (fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Hate to inconvenience you at the convenience store
But them jeans you wore are like I've never seen before
I pretend I work there while I clean the floor
Checkin' you out like the clerk while he rings you up
Pull out behind you when you're leavin'
And you don't even know it (word, yo Rick, man!)
She's brushin' her hair, adjustin' her mirror
She's rappin' my shit, but she wasn't aware
I was there, or maybe she was and just didn't care
Who knows? At least that ain't up in the air for some to see
So like a chick who thinks her coochie don't stink
If she ain't plannin' to do shit this summer's eve
Maybe she wants to keep me company
But fuck the Pepé Le Pew shit!
"Ain't steppin' to you, bitch," I say to myself
Plus she's bumpin' my music, ain't chasin' no tail like a skunk in heat
I could sweat her to some degree
But fuck it, I'm the male, let her come to me
(Could you repeat that again?)
"Letter" come to me "mail." "Sweater", "heat," "some degree."  Fail
Fuck it, pull up beside her
Sideswipe her Dodge Viper, wood is so bright
I ask does she want a computer lodged in her vagina
Said my dick is an apple, she said put it inside her
I said 

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I want it 

[Chorus: Mark Wahlberg (& John C. Reilly)]
All day, all night
You feel, my heat (fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Black out, come to, hands covered in blood
Motherfuckin' gloves and a shovel stuck in the mud
I just bodied the beat, so that hole musta been dug
'Cause it just died like food coloring (duh!)
So let's get turnt like a shish kabab
Twist it, ma, like an air-conditioning knob
We'd be great together
Don't care if it takes forever
If I gotta wait, I guess it's better late than never
You felt my heat rubbin' off on ya
I love your personality, come on, little mama
You're hot enough to melt Rick's beat, come jump in the water
I bet you get your self-esteem from your persona
With an ass to match, girl, your
Body is lit, you're striking, I'm a gas, girl, you're
Just gonna have to put them other chumps on the back burner
You got buns, I got Asperger's
Just let me rest my head between that set of D's
While I shred MC's like cheddar cheese
That's just the thoroughbred in me, ain't a better breed
My dog thinks so too look at my pedigree! (Roof!)
Ma, the world is what I think of you
I think you're divine, so I might swing on you
I'm just kiddin', girl, I wouldn't lift a finger, too
Unless it's the middle one to finger you

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I'll stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I want it 

[Chorus: Mark Wahlberg & John C. Reilly]
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
My heat

[Outro: Eminem & Mark Wahlberg]
On the ones and twos, to three or four in the mornin'
Rick's on the cut like Neosporin (Girls!)
He's mixin' it up for me, and you're in
A teddy like short for Theodore
We're outtie, five thousand
I wanna fuck, it's my big dick
So everybody get ready fucking now!

Arose by Eminem

[Part I: Arose]

If I could rewind time like a tape
Inside a boombox, one day for every pill or Percocet that I ate
Cut down on the Valium, I'da heard everything
But death is turning so definite wait!
They got me all hooked up to some machine
I love you, Bean, didn't want you to know I was struggling
Feels like I'm underwater submerged like a submarine
Just heard that nurse say, my liver and kidneys aren't functioning
Been flirtatious with death, skirt-chasing, I guess
It's arrivederci, same nurse, just heard say they're unplugging me
And it's your birthday, Jade, I'm missing your birthday
Baby girl, I'm sorry, I fucking hate when you hurt, Hai
And sweeties, thank you for waiting to open gifts
But, girls, you can just open 'em
Dad ain't making it home for Christmas
Wish I had the strength to just blow a kiss
I go to make a fist, but I can't make one, I'm frozen stiff
I yell, but nothing comes out, I'm crying inside, I shout
My vocal cords won't permit me, I scream, but it's not aloud
You put your arm around Momma to calm her, wow
I just thought about the aisle I'll never get to walk us down
Never see you graduate in your caps and gowns
It's 'bout to be 2008, how's this happening now?
I've got so much more to do
And, Proof, I'm truly sorry if I let you down, but this tore me in two
The thought of no more me and you
You gave me shoes, Nikes like new for me for school
Doody, I'm trying, but you, you were the glue that binded
So many things time, I'd give anything to rewind it
I had to walk down my halls and constantly be reminded
By pictures all on my walls and I couldn't sleep at night 'cause
That image burned in my brain of you on that table
Me falling across your body, not able to stand to save you
God, why did you take him?
I'm tryna keep his legacy alive, but I'm dying, where's Nathan?
Little ladies, be brave, take care of your mother
Smile pretty for pictures, always cherish each other
I'll always love ya, and I'll be in the back of your memory
And I know you'll never forget me
Just don't get sad when remembering
And, little bro, keep making me proud
You better marry that girl 'cause she's faithfully down
And when you're exchanging those sacred vows
Just know that if I could be there, I would
And should you ever see parenthood, I know you'll be good at it
Oh, almost forgot to do something, thank my father too
I actually learned a lot from you
You taught me what not to do
And, Mom, wish I'd have had the chance
To have one last heart-to-heart honest and open talk with you
Doody, I see you, I go to walk to you
And I can feel my soul leave my body and float across the room
Nurses lean over the bed, pulling tubes out
Then the sheet over my head, shut the room down
Girls, please don't get upset
I see them cheeks soaking and wet
As you squeeze hold of my neck, so forcibly, don't wanna let
Me go, pillow drenched, emotional wrecks
With every second, each closer to death
But suddenly I feel my heart begin to beat slow
Then a breath, machines go (beep beep beep)
Must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit
I'm tryna rewind time like a tape
Find an escape, make a beeline, try and awake
From this dream, I need to re-find my inner strength
To remind me, even if a steep climb I must take
To rewrite a mistake, I'm rewinding the tape

[Part II: Castle Extended]

(I don't want it!)
I'll put out this last album, then I'm done with it
One hundred percent finished, fed up with it
I'm hanging it up, fuck it!
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen, but I bet you they won't
I'm pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet
Shred these old letters I wrote
All that old pathetic loathing, closing credits can roll
I'm proud to be back
I'm 'bout to, like a rematch, outdo Relapse
With Recovery, Mathers LP2
Help propel me to victory laps
Gas toward 'em and fast forward the past
Consider them last four minutes as
The song I'da sang to my daughters
If I'da made it to the hospital less than 2 hours later, but I fought it
And came back like a boomerang on 'em
Now a new day is dawnin'
I'm up, Tuesday, it's mornin' now I know

Toilet flush

Perfect Symphony (Ed Sheeran & Andrea Bocelli) by Ed Sheeran

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Chorus 1: Ed Sheeran]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Christmas Time Is Here - Vocal by Vince Guaraldi Trio

[Verse 1]
Christmas time is here
Happiness and cheer
Fun for all that children call
Their favorite time of the year

[Verse 2]
Snowflakes in the air
Carols everywhere
Olden times and ancient rhymes
Of love and dreams to share

[Chorus]
Sleigh bells in the air
Beauty everywhere
Yuletide by the fireside
And joyful memories there
Christmas time is here
We'll be drawing near
Oh, that we could always see
Such spirit through the year

[Chorus]
Sleigh bells in the air
Beauty everywhere
Yuletide by the fireside
And joyful memories there
Christmas time is here
We'll be drawing near
Oh, that we could always see
Such spirit through the year

Motorcycle Patches by Huncho Jack

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Motorcycle patches on my jacket
Rip all the money out the plastic
Put it on her tongue and now she dancin'
Gave her everything, now what you asking?
Flip, make it flip, do gymnastics

Cold December Night by Michael Bublé

[Verse 1]
Stockings are hung with care
As children sleep with one eye open
Well now there's more than toys at stake
Cause I'm older now, but not done hoping

[Verse 2]
The twinkling of the lights
The scent of candles fill the household
'Ol Saint Nick has taken flight
With a heart on board, so please be careful

[Pre-Chorus]
Each year I ask for many different things
But now I know what my heart wants you to bring

[Chorus]
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that I will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night

[Verse 3]
A tree that smells of pine
A house that's filled with joy and laughter
The mistletoe says stand in line
Loneliness is what I've captured

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh but this evening can be a holy night
So cozy on up by the fireplace
And dim those Christmas lights

[Chorus]
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that we will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
So kiss me on this cold December night

[Bridge]
They call it the season of giving
I'm here, I'm yours for the taking
They call it the season of giving
I'm here, I'm yours

[Chorus]
Just fall in love with me this Christmas
There's nothing else that we will need this Christmas
Won't be wrapped under a tree
I want something that lasts forever
Cause I don't want to be alone tonight
I'll wear you like a Christmas sweater
Walk proudly to the mistletoe, tonight
I want something to last forever
So kiss me on this cold December Night

[Closing]
Call it the season of giving
I'm here, I'm yours for the taking
Call it the season of giving
I'm here, I'm yours

Mary's Boy Child / Oh My Lord by Boney M.

[Intro]
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

[Verse 1]
Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible said
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

[Chorus]
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Mary's boy child Jesus christ
Was born on Christmas day

[Verse 2]
While shepherds watch their flocks by night
They see a bright new shining star
They hear a choir sing a song, the music seemed to come from afar

[Chorus]
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today
And man will live forever more, because of Christmas day

(Humming)

[Bridge]
For a moment the world was aglow, all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted, "Let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace"

[Verse 3]
Now Joseph and his wife, Mary
Came to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear her child, not a single room was in sight

And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark, Mary's little boy was born

[Chorus]
Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas day
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas day

[Bridge]
Oh a moment the world was aglow, all the bells rang out
There were tears of joy and laughter
People shouted, "let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace"

[Outro]
Oh my Lord, you sent your son to save us
Oh my Lord, your very self you gave us
Oh my Lord, that sin may not enslave us
And love may reign once more

Oh my Lord, when in the crib they found him
Oh my Lord, a golden halo crowned him
Oh my Lord, they gathered all around him
To see him and adore

Oh my lord, with the child's adoration
Oh my Lord, there came great jubilation
Oh my Lord, and full of admiration
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

(This day will live forever)
Oh my Lord, they had become to doubt you (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord, what did they know about you? (He is the truth forever)
Oh my Lord, but they were lost without you (So praise the lord)
They needed you so bad (His light is shining on us)

Oh my lord, with the child's adoration (So praise the lord)
Oh my Lord, there came great jubilation (He is a jubilation)
Oh my Lord, and full of admiration (So praise the lord)
They realized what they had (Until the sun falls from the sky)

Oh my Lord, you sent your son to save us (Oh praise the lord)
Oh my Lord, your very self you gave us (This day will live forever)
Oh my Lord, that sin may not enslave us  (So praise the lord)
And love may reign once more

Pumped Up Kicks by Foster The People

[Verse 1]
Robert's got a quick hand
He'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette
Hanging out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid
Yeah, he found a six-shooter gun
In his dad's closet, boy in a box of fun things
I don't even know what
But he's coming for you, yeah, he's coming for you

[Chorus]
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet

[Verse 2]
Daddy works a long day
He be coming home late, and he's coming home late
And he's bringing me a surprise
'Cause dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice
I've waited for a long time
Yeah, the sleight of my hand is now a quick-pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
And say, "Your hair's on fire, you must've lost your wits," yeah

[Chorus]
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet

[Verse 1: André 3000]
My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so, and this I know for sure (Uh)
But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out the door? (Ah)
Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now (Uh)

For sticking to together 'cause we don't know how (C'mon)

You think you've got it, oh, you think you've got it
But  got it  just don't get it 'til there's nothing at all
We get together, oh, we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved
If what they say is  Nothing is forever 
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception?
So why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't want to hear me, you just want to dance

[Chorus: André 3000]
Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh)

Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Okay now, ladies (Yeah?)
Now, we gon' break this thing down in just a few seconds
Now don't have me break this thing down for nothing
Now I want to see y'all on your baddest behavior
Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor
Ah, here we go!

[Refrain: André 3000]
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)

[Bridge 2: André 3000]
Now all the Beyoncés and Lucy Lius
And baby dolls, get on the floor
You know what to do, oh, you know what to do
You know what to do

All The Stars (with SZA) by Kendrick Lamar

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)

[Chorus: SZA]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Mothafucka, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my momma, that's the realest shit

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)

[Chorus: SZA]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

[Verse 2: SZA]
Skin covered in ego
Get to talkin', I get involved, like a rebound
No control, no off switch
And the way that you bringin' me down
It's a turn on, get it away from me
Know you mean wrong, keep away from me
And it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah
I just cry for no reason
I just pray for no reason
I give thanks for the life, for the day
For the hours and another life breathin'
I did it all 'cause it feel good
You'd leave it all if it feel bad
Better live your life, we were runnin' out of time

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & SZA]
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)

[Chorus: SZA]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

All These Years by Camila Cabello

[Verse 1]
Your hair's grown a little longer
Your arms look a little stronger
Your eyes just as I remember (oh)
Your smile's just a little softer

[Pre-Chorus]
And I, yeah, I never prepared for a moment like that
Yeah, in a second it all came back, it all came back

[Chorus]
'Cause after all these years
I still feel everything when you are near
And it was just a quick "Hello," and you had to go
And you probably will never know
You're still the one I'm after all these years
(Oh yeah)

[Verse 2]
Couldn't help but overhear you
Sounds like you're happy with her
But does she kiss you like I kissed you?
Ooh, I wish I loved you like I miss you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I, yeah, I never prepared for a moment like that
Yeah, in a second it all came back, it all came back

[Chorus]
'Cause after all these years

'Cause after all these years
I still feel everything when you are near (you are near)
And it was just a quick "Hello," and you had to go (ooh)

Consequences by Camila Cabello

[Verse 1]
Dirty tissues, trust issues
Glasses on the sink, they didn't fix you
Lonely pillows in a stranger's bed
Little voices in my head
Secret keeping, stop the bleeding
Lost a little weight because I wasn't eating
All the songs that I can't listen to, to tell the truth

[Chorus]
Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences

[Verse 2]
Hesitation, awkward conversation
Running on low expectation
Every siren that I was ignoring
I'm paying for it

[Chorus]
Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
A steady place to let down my defenses
But loving you had consequences

[Bridge]
No, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Said, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Hey, yeah, no, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, mm

[Chorus]
Loving you was dumb, dark, and cheap
Loving you will still take shots at me
Found loving you was sunshine, but then it poured
And I lost so much more than my senses
'Cause loving you had consequences

[Outro]
Yeah, loving you

In the Dark by Camila Cabello

Vampires at the same places
Shadows, traces
I know that you feel me

You're runnin , runnin', runnin', runnin 
Making the rounds with all your fake friends
Runnin', runnin' away from it
You can strip down without showing skin, yeah

I can see you're scared of your emotions
I can see you're hoping, you're not hopeless
So why can't you show me?

I can see you re tired of the acting
So why can't you show me?

[Chorus]
Who are you in the dark? (I, I)

Secrets, endless

Into It by Camila Cabello

[Verse 1]
Ooh, I'm not a psychic
But I see myself all over you (ooh)
Ooh, I'm sick on you, sick on you
But you're the medicine, too (ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
The gravity can't hold us, your hands are outer space
I can't make sense of nothing and words just get in the way
This couch is getting smaller, but it's my favorite place
Don't even ask the question, you know what I'm gonna say

[Chorus]
I'm into it
Whatever trouble that you're thinking, I could get into it
I see a king-sized bed in the corner, we should get into it
All of the things, I wanna do to you is infinite
I mean, if you're into it, I'm into it

[Verse 2]
Ooh, I'm holding my, holding my breath
Until I'm turning blue (yeah, yeah)
Ooh, don't save me, don't save me, don't save me
I'll fall into you, fall into you

[Pre-Chorus]
This couch is getting smaller, but it's my favorite place
Don't even ask the question, you know what I'm gonna say

[Chorus]
I'm into it
Whatever trouble that you're thinking, I could get into it
I see a king-sized bed in the corner, we should get into it
All of the things, I wanna do to you is infinite
I mean, if you're into it, I'm into it

[Chorus Reprise]
I'm into it, I'm into it
Whatever trouble that you're thinking
I could get into it (I'm into it)
I see a king-sized bed in the corner
We should get into it (I'm into it)
Enough of the conversation, baby, let's get into it (I'm into it)
I mean, if you're into it, I'm into it

[Pre-Chorus]
The gravity can't hold us, your hands are outer space
I can't make sense of nothing, oh
This couch is getting smaller, but it's my favorite place
Don't even ask the question
You know what I'm gonna say (say baby)

[Chorus]
I'm into it
Whatever trouble that you're thinking, I could get into it (thinking, I...)
I see a king-sized bed in the corner, we should get into it  (into it, yeah)
All of the things I wanna do to you is infinite (everything is infinite)
I mean, if you're into it, I'm into it (if you're into it)
I'm into it, I'm into it

[Outro]
I'm into it, oh na na, I'm into it
I'm into it, oh na na, I'm into it
I'm into it, oh na na, I'm into it
I'm into it, if you're into it, I'm into it

Zombie by The Cranberries

[Verse 1]
Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?

[Pre-Chorus]
But you see, it's not me
It's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fightin'
With their tanks, and their bombs
And their bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are cryin'

[Chorus]
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh

[Post-Chorus]
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du

[Verse 2]
Another mother's breakin'
Heart is takin' over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the same old theme
Since nineteen-sixteen
In your head, in your head, they're still fightin'
With their tanks, and their bombs
And their bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are dyin'

[Chorus]
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh-oh, ra-ra

Something's Gotta Give by Camila Cabello

[Verse 1]
Loving you, I thought I couldn't get no higher
Your November rain could set the night on fire, night on fire
But we could only burn so long
Counterfeit emotions only run skin deep
Know you're lying when you're lying next to me, next to me
How did we get so far gone?

[Pre-Chorus]
I should know by now
You should know by now
We should know by now

[Chorus]
Something's gotta give, something's gotta break
But all I do is give, and all you do is take
Something's gotta change, but I know that it won't
No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go, ooh

[Verse 2]
I have never heard a silence quite so loud
I walk in the room and you don't make a sound, make a sound
You're good at making me feel small
If it doesn't hurt me, why do I still cry?
If it didn't kill me, then I'm half alive, half alive
How did we get so far gone?

[Pre-Chorus]
I should know by now
You should know by now
We should know by now

[Chorus]
Something's gotta give, something's gotta break
But all I do is give, and all you do is take
Something's gotta change, but I know that it won't
No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go

[Bridge]
I should know by now, you should know by now
I think I'm breaking right now, ooh
I should know by now, you should know by now
I think I'm breaking right now

[Chorus]
Something's gotta give, something's gotta break
But all I do is give, and all you do is take
Something's gotta change, but I know that it won't
No reason to stay is a good reason to go
Is a good reason to go, ooh

Linger by The Cranberries

[Verse 1]
If you, if you could return
Don't let it burn
Don't let it fade
I'm sure I might be rude
But it's just your attitude
It's tearing me apart
It's ruining everything
And I swore, I swore I would be true
And honey, so did you
So why were you holding her hand?
Is that the way we stand?
Were you lying all the time?
Was it just a game to you?

[Chorus]
But I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

[Verse 2]
Oh, I thought the world of you
I thought nothing could go wrong
But I was wrong, I was wrong
If you, if you could get by
Trying not to lie
Things wouldn't be so confused
And I wouldn't feel so used
But you always really knew
I just want to be with you

[Chorus]
And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

Yeah, there ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, okay

[Verse 1]
Met you out on Broadway on the hottest night in town
We arrived solo but we were being chased around
Saw you being cornered by some guy you used to know
Stepped in between the both of y'all, said "I'm leaving, do you wanna go?"

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity
Some shit start to go down, I'll be the one with the level head
The world could end now, baby, we'll be living in The Walking Dead

'Cause I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies

The multiple times, stop, hit the set
You ain't had it that way, I can guarantee you that

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be the light when you can't see

The world could end now
Baby, we'll be living in The Walking Dead

[Bridge]
Now I wanna know everything
Don't leave a single detail out
I'll get mine later, just fell out
It makes me a generous lover
Ooh, I wanna see everything
So don't leave a single detail out
I want it all on the table
The personal way to, wait

So much ice, young nigga, he delirious
Never too much jewelry, I'm serious (no)
Quarter ticket, half a ticket, once I get it, spend it (spend it)
Quarter ticket, half a ticket, I'm a walkin' chicken (brr)
Quarter ticket, half a ticket, this is not a gimmick (no)
Money comin' in, they think we the ones that print it

[Verse: Takeoff]
Nah f'real, we the ones that print it
We the ones that trend it, it's a slight few, ain't many
Started it from the beginnin' (back then), they say money make 'em envy (envy)
My diamonds drawin' attention (look) and they wet like Willie (splash)
Pocket cheesesteak, Philly (cheese), bitch bad and she with it (bitch)
But I won't give her a penny (nah), tryna go to Piccadilly (where?)
Rose gold's got drillin', oh what a beautiful feelin' (beautiful)
I'ma let you get the bitch (bitch), but I'ma go get me some millions (M&M's)
I chose to give me some paper (chose to), that was my own decision (mine)
Speed racin' in that Lamborghini, I done fucked around and blew the engine
I pour an 8, on top of 8 I just poured, drank fuckin' wit' my vision
200K, count it before I do shows and fuck your opinion (nigga, fuck, opinion)
They told me I wouldn't make it, said I wouldn't amount to shit (shit)
Nigga smilin' in your face, really want you in a ditch
Half a ticket on my neck, quarter ticket on my wrist
This that new Richard Mille plain Jane like a bitch
They think that this shit is new, but we been really doing this
Talkin' pointers but you don't get points and don't get no assists
They say the ones that quiet be the ones that rich as bricks
Wanna walk in my shoes, gotta take that risk (risk)

[Chorus: Takeoff & Quavo]
I just spent a cool half a ticket on my jewelry (ice)
Clear white diamonds make your eyesight blurry (blurry)
Excuse me I have on too much jewelry (skrrt, skrrt)
Never too much, never too much, so much
I just cashed out on my neck, that's a house
Air it out, fuck a spouse, we pop off, we ain't hearin' it (brrr)
So much ice, young nigga, he delirious
Never too much jewelry, I'm serious (no)
Quarter ticket, half a ticket, once I get it, spend it (spend it)
Quarter ticket, half a ticket, I'm a walkin' chicken (brr)
Quarter ticket, half a ticket, this is not a gimmick (no)
Money comin' in, they think we the ones that print it

[Bridge: Quavo]
This ain't even all my jewelry (jewelry)
Never too much jewelry (jewel)
This ain't even half my jewelry (never too much)
Never too much jewelry (yeah)

[Interlude: Quavo]
Mike Dean, Zaytoven
You know how we do it
Never too much jewelry, jewelry
Too much ice (all these jewels)
Wassup, baby?
I see you bitch over there lookin', nigga, muah
Skeleton AP on my wrist, nigga
Takeoff just bought like eight plain Janes
Haha, know you're mad, nigga

[Chorus: Takeoff & Quavo]
I just spent a cool half a ticket on my jewelry (ice)
Clear white diamonds make your eyesight blurry (blurry)
Excuse me I have on too much jewelry (skrrt, skrrt)
Never too much, never too much, so much
I just cashed out on my neck, that's a house
Head out, fuck a spouse, we pop off, we ain't hearin' it (brrr)
So much ice, young nigga, he delirious
Never too much jewelry, I'm serious

Man of the Woods by Justin Timberlake

[Chorus]
I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I try
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride

[Verse 1]
Hey, sugar plum, look at where we are
So tonight, if I take it too far, that's okay because you know
(That's okay because you know)
I hear the making up's fun
Been a minute since we've had some time to breathe
So if you see another side of me that's okay because you know
(That's okay because you know)
I hear the making up's fun

[Pre-Chorus]
But then your hands talking, fingers walking, down your legs
Hey, there's the faucet
Someone's knocking like they know
But baby, don't you stop it, yes I'm watching
Your hand slides down the light
And girl you know

[Chorus]
I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I try
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride

[Verse 2]
Well, I got your sweet with a twist of lime
And this one's neat, well you know that's mine, here we go
And do it twice 'cause you know we like it
And damn anybody if they disagree
They don't understand you're just like me, they don't know
We do it twice 'cause we know we like it

[Pre-Chorus]
But then your hands talking, fingers walking, down your legs
Hey, there's the faucet
Someone's knocking like they know
But baby, don't you stop it, yes I'm watching
Your hand slides down the light (light, light)
And girl you know

[Chorus]
I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I try
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride

[Bridge]
How do I ever explain what I've got with you?
I try to find the words but they hide and that's the truth
And nobody ever will understand what we do
There's only one me and you
Come here, hold me
'Cause there's only one me and you
Yeah, there's only one me and you, uh
There's only one me and you
You know there's only one me and you

[Chorus]
I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I try
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride

[Outro]
I wrote this to let you know
And I let them feelings show
I'm the man of the woods and you're my pride
Ooh, I can't make them understand
But you know I'm a Southern man
A man of the woods and you're my pride
Ohh, hey, hey
A man of the woods, it's my pride
Now let the beat ride like...

[Refrain]
Ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, there ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, okay

[Verse 1]
Met you out on Broadway on the hottest night in town
We arrived solo but we were being chased around
Saw you being cornered by some guy you used to know
Stepped in between the both of y'all, said "I'm leaving, do you wanna go?"

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity
Some shit start to go down, I'll be the one with the level head
The world could end now, baby, we'll be living in The Walking Dead

[Chorus]
'Cause I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies
I got you, I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies

[Verse 2]
I don't know if you 'member this, but I was out of town
Flew in on a 3 AM just to show up and hear your sounds
The multiple times, stop, hit the set
You ain't had it that way, I can guarantee you that

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity
Some shit start to go down, I'll be the one with the level head
The world could end now, baby, we'll be living in The Walking Dead

[Chorus]
'Cause I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies
I got you, I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies

[Refrain]
Ain't no need of stopping, girl
Can't nobody top it, girl
Ain't no better option, girl (okay)
Ain't nobody stopping, girl
This here when I drop in, girl
I work, work when I clock in, girl (okay)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity
Some shit start to go down, I'll be the one with the level head
The world could end now
Baby, we'll be living in The Walking Dead

[Bridge]
Now I wanna know everything
Don't leave a single detail out
I'll get mine later, just fell out
It makes me a generous lover
Ooh, I wanna see everything
So don't leave a single detail out
I want it all on the table
The personal way to, wait

[Refrain]
Ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, there ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, okay

[Chorus]
'Cause I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies
I got you, I got supplie-ie-ies

[Verse 2: Mozzy]
I cried when lil' bruh died
Got high and watched the sunrise
Wiggle on 'em if it's one time
They done hung all of my people
I love all of my people
I'm in the slums with all of my people
They tryna tell us that we all equal
We get no justice so it ain't peaceful, yeah
They can bluff you, they can beat you
Paid attorney, we gon' need it
Momma told me there was demons
And she ain't never lied on her Jesus'
She worked her ass off just to feed us
She went to Ross to cop the new Adidas
She used to tap in with all the teachers
They wasn't teachin' nothin', it's no secret
Whole lotta crime, lil' niggas beefin'
We gotta keep it or end up a victim
Trapped in the system, traffickin' drugs
Modern-day slavery, African thugs
We go to war for this African blood
We go to war for this African blood
When I put niggas on, it was all out of love
You was disloyal, can't call it no love

[Chorus: Sjava]
Poverty, jealousy, negativity
Ngith' ak'nandawo la
Go away (far away)

[Verse 3: Reason]
(Season change) You know we off the stove with it
We stove whippin', niggas know we gon' get it
(Season change) Dodgin' cops
Fuck around and get locked, you ain't never comin' home with it
Look, my nigga, I came from the sewer
Don't shit on my past, you ain't come from manure
You see Reason and you see LA
But bitch I ain't come for no ruin
Just know all of my niggas, we struggled for it
Had to hustle for it, cried puddles for it
My pops watched his sister get locked for it
I done seen my niggas get knocked for it like gunshot
Gimme that, I carry Del Amo like a piggyback
I carry my city like guilt that ain't got no forgiveness
No way out, shit we locked in the system
Catch a case and they not gon' forgive ya
White skin, you be out before Christmas
Shit, auntie missed eight of those days
Tears from me, had to pray those days
Had to slave those days
Shit, we had to hit up a couple hood giveaways those days
Thank God for every inch that he gave us
Thank God for everything cause he made us
Like when that car bent the block, blat blat
Hit the homie but we made it to ER and he saved us
Thinkin' that he could've died, nigga
We was prayin' to the sky and his momma cried rivers
Healed up, but tough luck, he tried to get revenge
Had to drop, bullets popped and they killed him
Worst part is that it sound so familiar

Ain't it righteous? Amen (amen)

This time around, there's time to turn it around
This time around, there's still time to turn it around

Thunder by Imagine Dragons

[Verse 1]
Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind
Not a "Yes, sir," not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

[Pre-Chorus]
Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

[Chorus]
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning and the thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning and the thunder, thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder (Thun-, thun-)

[Verse 2]
Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say, "You're basic," they say, "You're easy"
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nosebleeds

[Pre-Chorus]
Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

[Chorus]
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning and the thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning and the thunder, thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder (Thun-, thun-)

[Bridge]
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder

[Chorus]
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
(Never give up, never give up)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
(Never give up on your dreams)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
(Never give up, never give up)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
(Never give up on your dreams)

[Outro]
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
(Woah-oh-ohh)

Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

Believer by Imagine Dragons

[Verse 1]
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

[Chorus]
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Verse 2]
Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was chokin' in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

[Chorus]
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

[Bridge]
Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

[Chorus]
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Whatever It Takes by Imagine Dragons

[Verse 1]
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Verse 2]
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system; a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

We ain't throwin' hands in this bih (Throw a couple hands)
Throw a couple bands in the bih (I'ma throw a couple bands)
Tell the bitches do the dance on the dick
Handstand off the bando and she lit, lit

Cocky (feat. London On Da Track) by A$AP Rocky

[Intro: Gucci Mane, Skooly, 21 Savage & A$AP Rocky]
Huh?
We got London On Da Track
It's Guwop
Uh
It's Gucci
21, 21
Uh

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & 21 Savage]
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky

[Verse 1: 21 Savage & A$AP Rocky]
I got so many M's in my bank account, I can't even count 'em
Too many whips, way I switch my car, I can't even mount 'em
Too many zeros with Versace pillows in my Phantoms
Too many bad bitches, I don't cuff 'em, I just hand them (21)
Off like a lay-up (lay-up), I don't got time to lay up
Met my accountant at Ruth's Chris, she told me that I'm way up (21)
I already back for seconds, I ain't even clean my plate up
Ran me up a hunned M's and then I put my bay up (21)
Way out in the hills, I just sign the deal
I ain't take no advance, so you know that split was real (21)
All my diamonds carats, them lil' pointers be too lil'
Glaciers in my ear, I need a cup, they 'bout to spill (Uh)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & A$AP Rocky]
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I feel like I'm Rocky

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Huh?
How you gon' play D, can't even take D?
Too many fake me's
Way too many fake daps, way too many fake '$APs
And I put it on me  and I want another ring
Girlies buckle at the knees, swerve 'em like the other team (Skrrt)
You can still hear the sneaks (Woo, swoosh)
Ballin' in some Dungarees
Make a cheerleader cream, so what she on the other team?
For the cameras say your cheese, rap game like the league
Heard you the nigga overseas, but that's only overseas
I'm the one who oversees shit, "Oh man, it's him again"
I'm up in the rim, Gatorade and M&M's
Ball on you in my favorite Timberlands
My girlfriend got a little friend
All the way on the other end
'Cause she don't deal with the middle man
Harlem world stole my flow, friends and my foes
Got my hoes in my clothes, they want ten like my toes (A$AP)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby , I'm too fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky (Yeah)

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
Just pass me the rock and watch him go
Just run me the play and let me know
With a broken leg, I let it go (Leggo, leggo, leggo)
I ain't gotta say it 'cause they know (Woo)

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Gucci is materialistic, he's too fuckin' flashy
He smoke when he wanna smoke, think the world is his ashtray
So, so deaf to these suckers, I'm like JD in '03
My hoe said that I'm too cocky, I don't play nothin' but me
These girls got nothing to show you, I'll give you something to see
These dudes keep comin' up short like they a pair of capris
Don't group me with these rappers, these boys embarrassin' me
Them dudes ain't got nothin' on me, I got a money disease
I'm too cold for these suckers, they ain't got more money than me
I wear my mink in the summer when it's a hundred and three (Burr)
I make a bitch feel self-conscious like she too shiny for me
I know that bitch want to fuck me, but she's too tiny for me
It's my way or the highway, you either like or leave
This Rollie cost us the G's, a couple bricks on my sleeve (Yeah)
When I first fell on the scene, I drove a Cutlass Supreme
A half a brick, a pint of lean, and a new money machine
It's Wop

[Chorus: Gucci Mane, & Skooly]
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky (It's Gucci)
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky (Wizop)
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky (Damn)

Not invited, but I'm glad I made it, oh

Let me apologize, yeah

Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, could you come here please? 'Cause I wanna be with you

[Verse 3: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Wait, can we work this out?
I've been thinkin' out loud all day
Don't let me down
Can't live without my bae
And she wanna leave, but I think it's easier
If you let me be
You should come and see me, girl
Just think about it, girl
You should know I still think about you, yeah
I know you're into diamonds
I can tell you everything defined in you
But I'm like...

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, can you come here please?
'Cause I wanna be with you
Wait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
Just wait, can we work this out, can we work this out?
Just wait, could you come here please?
'Cause I wanna be with you

Yeah, yeah, SlayDro!
This that J Dilla right here
Badu, Indica Badu
Yeah, that's right...

[Verse 1: Logic]
Riding 'round the city with my homies, blowing trees
Wavy like the Seven Seas, living life, let me get it right
Let me give it a minute to get up in it like a beautiful independent woman that's finna make you wait to smash
Come now, let me count this cash
Come now, let me sip this flask
Pockets fat like shawty ass
Jump in the whip, gotta get this gas
Put that shit in drive, I'm live like ammunition
No permission needed, I proceeded to accelerate
Had days with hella hate, but gotta let that anger migrate
All this shit that's on my plate
That food for thought that can't be bought
But only taught, and on the real, know

[Chorus: Logic]
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it
I can't get much higher 

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nigga, like we smoking all weekend
And I roll and smoke when I'm drinkin'
Tell them open that door but don't peek in
We be havin' a OG Kush meetin'
If we smokin' that dope, it's a reason
Eyes so low from the chiefin'
I be getting high when I wake up
And roll me one more 'fore I'm sleeping
Man, I be smoking so good that I be forgetting the past
It don't even come to my house
If it ain't wrapped up in a turkey bag
We roll up the herb and laugh, kick back, blow a zip
Take it on a plane, know I smoke the same when I'm on a trip
Nigga like me always got weed on 'em (got weed on 'em)
Try to tell me that she don't smoke, later on she joinin'
Ain't no point, no I'm back, keep going in
You been rolling with cats, who boring
I be bringing them stacks enormous
Section always in the back important
Bad bitch gorgeous, pack imported

[Chorus: Logic]
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it
I can't get much higher 

[Verse 3: Logic]
Uh, yeah, I'm finna get up in the feeling
Independent feeling like a boss
Roll a little something, smoke a little something
Kick back and then floss
Chiefin' that Indica in the cut, tell my anxiety to get lost
Fuck a pill, only numb the pain
Man, you know how much that shit cost?
I ain't talking 'bout your pocket
No, I am only talking about the mind
When the cannabis combine with the brain
It be like everything you see, it seem to shine
Smoking that Golden State, everything going great
Got a lot on my plate, not a single complaint
Stack of money in the bank
This that RattPack and that Taylor Gang
They know the face and they know the name
I'm a married man with a bad wife
Never fuck around unless it's Mary Jane
Come play the game, honestly never the same
Just like my flow, got one for every occasion
Living the life so my life is amazing, woo

[Chorus: Logic]
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it
I can't get much higher, been smoking that fire
Riding 'round the city with my homies that know me
Know that I can't get much higher, word to my supplier
While you break it, roll it, light it, use that fire, ignite it
I can't get much higher 

[Outro: Logic]

You niggas hold up, don't get no closer

High powers chose us, we never froze up

Hold up, wait a second, chill
Uh, I mean to Maryland, DC, Virginia

Uh, don't do this shit for the thrill
Uh, I am coming for the kill
Tell me how you want it, gotta pedal to the metal
I'm a gunner like a semi-automatic, I'm bringin' the static
I had it, I had to get a unhooked like an addict
And yeah, I'm glad that it went the way it did
Never thought the radio would play the kid
They never care 'til you make it big
Now they say triple platinum
Finger-fuck the people said that never would happen
Came a long way from the trap
Where they was cookin' up crack
I'm still here, RattPack keep it real here
Big boy money, Uncle Phil here
Only "Fresh Prints" in my pocket
I came from nothin', no hater can stop it
Only the illest, you know that I got it

My name is Paul Rothenberg, Attorney of Law...
And I hereby ratify and confirm that Logic is motherfucking paid

Can't nothin' stop me, I'm on a roll (I'm on a roll!)
Always on time 'cause my eyes is on my Rollie-olex
I don't trust nobody, oh no (No, no, no!)

Fuck with me now or you'll never know (Never know!)

Logic ain't here right now, leave a message if you want, ho

[Verse]
Hold it, bring it back, uh, I'ma call you back, uh
Too busy countin' stacks, uh
Pickin' up the slack (slack!)
I was born in the trap (trap!), chains on, cooked crack (Crack!)
Logic never wanna flex, but Bobby finna bring the facts
Put my city on the map, fuck with the gang, get attacked
It ain't a thing, RattPack, nobody know about that
Bitch, I been gunnin', comin' for the throne
And I know that they talking, can't fuck with the tone
Talkin' shit 'bout Logic, I never respond
I'll let success talk, 'cause a word of advice:
More achievements for yourself and less talk
Cats beef with Logic, yeah, they prayin' I respond
If I ever did, I dead you in this game with no respawn
Peace, love, and positivity, that's all I want with you
But you push the issue 'cause I give you more press than your publicist could ever get you
Hell nah, fuck rap, fuck beef
Anyone that hate me, I wish you success
I wish you look in the mirror and ask yourself why you suppressed
The feelin's of self-hatred that you want project on me
Bet if I never picked up the mic then we might be homies
But you jealous, you look at my life and you feel envy
Constantly comparing yourself to me and feel empty
Most people that don't fuck with me ain't never shook my hand
I'm a good man, yeah, I love myself
I know who I am, yeah, I love myself
They don't understand
But no matter what happen you know that 

[Chorus]
Can't nothing stop me, I'm on a roll (I'm on a roll)
Always on time 'cause my eyes is on my Rollie-olex (Woo!)
I don't trust nobody, oh no (No, no, no!)
I don't trust nobody, put my homies on the payroll
Fuck with me now or you'll never know (Never know!)
If you weren't with me, in the beginning, you get no love (No love!)
My name Bobby Tarantino (Tarantino!)
Logic ain't here right now, leave a message if you want, ho (Leave a message, ho!)

Pimpin' ain't a thang, what's good?
Hold up, let me get it right, I been contemplating life

I don't know how this right here could go wrong
This is my theme song, me and my team's song
I got millions in the bank because my dream's strong
I don't sip the syrup, I got friends to lean on
But I get my green on, yes, I get my green on
Pull up in this bitch and smoke a O

About to blow, about to show
About to show 'em, I don't know 'em

Lil' Bobby never second-guessed that he gon' make it one day
One way or another, my brother, word to your mother
They should give me a badge 'cause I'm always under covers
Goddamn! I'm a miraculous man!
You know I get, I get it, I get it, I get it
The Young Sinatra spit it, rewind it, and rip it
I could murder your whole album with a 30-second snippet
Pass the Mary Jane like I'm runnin' a train with Peter Parker
On tour, I have more sex in the city than Sarah Jessica Parker
The deeper and deeper I go, it get darker
They say they want the old me, they want the Young Sinatra back
The one that murder it, rip it up, no, never givin' up 'round the almanac
Yeah, I'm all of that, fall back, like September again
Baskin' these rappers so hard they won't remember again
When it comes to hip-hop, bitch, I'm indigenous to this
It's apparent I'm bearin' down like a parent
When the beef is at stake, I'm Mastro's
My god-level lyricism surpass flows, I'm much more than fast flows
Money, talk, cash knows, greatest of levels I've passed those

[Chorus: Bobby Tarantino]
Fuck that rap shit, this that trap shit (Bobby!)
This world is my contraption (Bobby!)
I was born and raised in the trap, son (Bobby!)
Talk shit, get kidnapped, son (Bobby!)
I don't really know why I rap, son (ay!)
Money in the bank, yeah, I got some (ay!)
Couple sports cars, yeah, I bought some (ay!)
Logic never flex, Bobby get it done! (ay!)
Yeah, y'all don't really know where I come from (come now)
Talkin' that shit, I'ma come for 'em (what's good?)
Tell me what you really know about me right now
Anything I want, I get it somehow

[Verse 2: Young Sinatra]
Fuck that trap shit, this that rap shit
Give me the head like John the Baptist
Ready to rip it, I hope in the captives
Greatest alive like I'm Cassius
I put 'em all in they caskets, they can't seem to get past it
I'm a bastard that mastered the flow
And none of y'all ready for the massacre, though
Fuck with Logic? Yeah, that's a no
Matter of fact, it's not impossible, just highly improbable
Like, saying the police isn't robbable
But I'm liable to walk up in the station in blue-face
Like, "Fuck the police!" Blue lives ain't a race
Fuck whoever said this rap shit was never a race
This shit a marathon
Murder you motherfuckers and carry on
Claimin' that you really 'bout this shit
You got your Jim Carrey on 
Liar Liar; I might crucify ya
Number one till I die, will never retire
I am the Messiah, I am the god of this shit
This is how we do it yeah, I started this shit
Yes, I started this shit like 

[Chorus: Bobby Tarantino]
Fuck that rap shit, this that trap shit (Bobby!)
This world is my contraption (Bobby!)
I was born and raised in the trap, son (Bobby!)
Talk shit, get kidnapped, son (Bobby!)
I don't really know why I rap, son (ay!)
Money in the bank, yeah, I got some (ay!)
Couple sports cars, yeah, I bought some (ay!)
Logic never flex, Bobby get it done! (ay!)
Yeah, y'all don't really know where I come from (come now)
Talkin' that shit, I'ma come for 'em (what's good?)
Tell me what you really know about me right now
Anything I want, I get it somehow

Wizard Of Oz by Logic

[Chorus]
Bitch, I've been runnin' my city like I am the Wizard of Oz
I don't do this shit for nothin' but the family and the squad
Money ain't everything, tell me now, what's that money to a god?
If they tell you money make you better than others, then somebody lied
Bitch, I've been runnin' my city like I am the Wizard of Oz (yeah, I am)

I just paid ten million in taxes
Finger-fuck all of them bastards way back in my GED classes
I don't mean to stunt on they asses, but I'm finna stunt on they asses
Yeah, I'm finna stunt on they asses
Fast forward, I rap for the masses, from Maryland to Calabasas
It's on, all this other shit that's on my mind now
My girl said she wanna let me find out
I'm way too diverse to stay in one lane
Increase the autotune so y'all could feel the pain (yeah, yeah!)
Pour that drink up and might have to catch a vibe (catch a vibe!)
I am way too turnt right now, don't need to drive (woo!)
I might fuck around and say some real shit (yeah!)
Like people tend to do when they get real, real lit, yeah (woo!)
I've been sippin' on that liquid courage (ooh, ooh, yeah!)
The beat is tellin' me, "Don't be discouraged"
I think I'm the best rapper alive
'Cause they tell me I'm the best rapper alive

[Chorus]
Bitch, I've been runnin' my city like I am the Wizard of Oz
I don't do this shit for nothin' but the family and the squad
Money ain't everything, tell me now, what's that money to a god?

State Of Emergency by Logic

[Intro: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
2 Chainz

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Okay, I think these niggas is tryin' me
The irony, I used to iron jeans that had the heavy crease
You know my destiny is somewhere over the catastrophe
You know your majesty
You don't smoke strong, that's muscle atrophy
That's such a tragedy
I see murder like it's Master P
Drug dealin' academy, summa cum laude
I made A's, rarely made a B
Watch 1080p, cost 80 apiece
I need 80G, verses ADD (tell 'em)
It was me versus the APD (APD)
'Cause they know I'm ballin' hard like the ACC (sweet)
I ride this beat like an ATV
To see me you need HDTV
Bein' broke is like an allergy

[Verse 2: Logic]
Ballin' with my homies now, everybody know me now
But they don't really know me now
Yeah, this shit is real life
Haters talk shit, but deep down still wonder what it feel like
Yeah, you know I am right, I just signed a 30 million dollar deal
How that feel? Goddamn right, no, that ain't a rapper flex
I just gotta let 'em know
That money don't mean shit without self-respect
Built myself an empire
You can have rap, I'ma set the whole wide world on fire
RattPack, that's a fact
How you go from Bobby Tarantino to the boom bap? It's a trap
Bring it right back, I do it all 'cause I'm like that
You can't put me in a box, my talent put me in the mansion
Rap without Logic, like the game with no expansion
Answer, damn I'm feelin' handsome
I ain't in the club throwin' dollars, I'm at GameStop
'Member used to sell trees on the same block
I went platinum and double platinum then triple platinum
From rappin', I'm snappin', I'm snappin'
They wonder what happened
They was hatin', now they clappin' like, "Yeah, yeah
Bobby got the Grammy this year"
Call me Nostradamus, not cocky, I'm honest, well to be honest
I spit the finest of flows, I count cash, you count hoes
You'll never get, that's why your shit is counterfeit
This that Reasonable Doubt shit, Jay in his prime
This a state of emergency, now sound the alarm
I'm comin' for your neck, but first I'ma slice off the arm
Of anybody who ever try to bite the hand that fed 'em
I'm too powerful, try to double-cross me and I dead 'em
Kill 'em with kindness, you too weak like "7 x 2"
So show some respect when this muscle comes through, woo!

[Skit]
Morty: Hey, uh, Grandpa Rick, can we maybe... maybe I can pick what we listen to next? You know... we've been in this ship for like three hours now
Rick: Well, Morty, that entirely depends on whether or not you have the mental capacity to pick something I would be willing to listen to
Morty: Well, what about Logic?
Rick: Logic?
Morty: You're not fuckin' with Logic? Bro? You know what I'm talkin' about?
Rick: Morty, calm down, of course, I love Logic. Who doesn't like Logic? You gotta be a fuckin' idiot if you don't like Logic. But the question is, what "Logic" are we talkin' about here?
Morty: What do you mean?
Rick: Well are we talkin' about mixtape Logic or album Logic?
Morty: What does it matter? I mean Logic is Logic
Rick: Morty, it matters very much
Morty: I don't know, Rick, I mean... album Logic?
Rick: Ugh, Morty I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to decline a request
Morty: What? Grandpa Rick, are you saying you don't like Logic albums?
Rick: Morty, if that's what I was trying to say, I would have said it. Don't come at me like a little punk ass motherfucker, don't try to come at me, Morty. I'm saying that he's got a plethora of music that varies from mood to mood, Morty. Okay? And I'm saying that I'm in the mood to turn some shit up, Morty. I'm not in the mood for a message about how I can be whatever I want or oohhh you know like equality and everybody and all that shit, alright? Just wanna hear some fuckin'... about titties, throwin' stacks on some ass, you know, just some good old fuckin' ATL style club rap, Morty
Morty: Geez, Rick, I mean, Logic he turns stuff up on his albums too, Rick, you know? He turns shit up
Rick: Morty, shut up. I'm simply implying, you know, I want some shit I can turn up on this ride to Clazabar planet in sector G9, okay
Morty: Alright, geez, okay
Rick: So, you know, so, meet me in the middle, Morty. Give me some of that Bobby Tarantino shit. You're talking about Logic, you know and I'm talking about that titty rap. Jus- why don't we meet in the middle with some Bobby Tarantino, you know. I need it, just need to hear it, it's pretty good
Morty: Yeah, you know I agree with you Rick, here I'm gonna throw this Bobby Tarantino shit in
Rick: Yeah, drop that shit, drop that shit, Morty! Drop that shit in my fucking spaceship, Spaceship!
Spaceship: Yes, Rick?
Rick: Uh, play Bobby Tarantino

You Owe Me by The Chainsmokers

[Verse 1]
I don't really say this that often
But there's somethin' that the papers forgot
Every time I read them, I know I feed them
But I know, they're painting, but they can't leave a mark
'Cause my friends don't read the papers
And they don't really care if we're awesome or not
So every time I read them, I know I feed them
But I know, they wanna see me hang on the wall

[Chorus]
You don't know me, don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse, and if I'm dead, you owe me
If you're lonely, don't you think you're on your own?
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse, and if I'm there, you owe me

[Verse 2]
Say it to my face if you mean it
Say it to my face, but you won't
I know I'm not losin', but I'm losin' my mind
Does anybody know what that's like?

[Chorus]
You don't know me, don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse, and if I'm dead, you owe me
If you're lonely, don't you think you're on your own?
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse, and if I'm there, you owe me

[Bridge]
Yeah, if I'm there, you owe me
Yeah, if I'm there, you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
If I'm there, you owe me

Yeah, if I'm there, you owe me
(If I'm dead, if I'm dead, if I'm dead, you owe me)

[Chorus]
You don't know me, don't you think that I get lonely?
It gets dark inside my head
Check my pulse and if I'm dead, you owe me
If you're lonely, don't you think you're on your own?
When it gets dark inside your head
Check my pulse, and if I'm there, you owe me

Be Careful by Cardi B

[Intro]
Yeah
Care for me, care for me, care for me, uh
Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga

[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me

[Bridge]
Care for me, care for me
Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me
Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look

[Verse 2]
I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga

[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me

Yeah, we straight but if you wrinkle up the situation he will go grab the iron
And he do what I says like Simon
(No violence)
And my bitch mixed like jambalaya
Man, fuck with the fam, we in Japan
Bitch you re a bum, see you don't understand
Yeah, I cut off some friends, "T where you been?"
Bitch I'm in Bel-Air, been lookin' for land
Need a spot in the hills, not the beach, need a pool
Just to cool it, I do need the grass, not the sand
Got enough rocks, see, check my hand
And I got crack, watch how I talk
And it's still Wolf Gang, bitch, watch how I bark
Wallace still trippin' on shit that I bought
But I really do not care the cost 'cause okra

[Outro]
Man, now they go
I cut off some friends

Bad bitch pretty, she pretty bad
She might get a bag that come with a bag
Pull out a molly bag, let her dib and dab
Let the money talk 'til it jibber jab
My plug just hit me with the give and go
Now I'm over the stove and I'm whipping Nash
Tell the boogeyman "I'm the bigger man,"
Tell the trigger man, "pull the trigger, man"
Pull up on yo ass, two seater
Pull off fast like a loose cheetah
One diamond ring on two fingers
Cheating on these hoes, call me Tune Cheadle
Look how they grinnin' and blushin'

[Intro]
Huh, yeah, naw I just, had a lil' bit too much of Hennessy
Just gotta tell you how I feel, look

[Verse 1]
You so fuckin' precious when you smile
Hit it from the back and drive you wild
Girl, I lose myself up in those eye-eye-eye-eye-eyes
I just had to let you know you're mine

[Chorus]
Hands on your body, I don't wanna waste no time
Feels like forever even if forever's tonight
Just lay with me, waste this night away with me
You're mine, I can't look away, I just gotta say

[Verse 2]
I'm so fucking happy you're alive
Swear to God I'm down if you're down all you gotta say is right
Girl anything I can do just to make you feel alright
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I just had to let you know you're fine
Running circles 'round my mind
Even when it's rainy all you ever do is shine
You on fire, you a star just like Mariah
Man this feel incredible, I'll turn you into a bride, you're mine

[Chorus]
Hands on your body, I don't wanna waste no time

Thru Your Phone by Cardi B

[Verse 1: Cardi B]
Look, I just want to break up all your shit, call your mama phone
Let her know that she raised a bitch, then dial tone, click
And fuck your little fake ass friends
Come around actin' like they my bros
I seen y'all little group texts
Where you all like to brag about your hoes
And you can tell your little bitch
I screenshotted all her naked pics
Oh, you wanna send nudes to my man?
Wake up and see your boobs on the 'Gram?
Lil' bitch, I cannot stand you, right hand to Jesus
I might just cut all the tongues out your sneakers
Smash your TV from Best Buy
You gon' turn me into Left Eye
I don't wanna hear 'bout invasion of privacy
I had a feeling, it turns out you lie to me
I'm holdin' back everything that's inside of me
How you out fuckin' with bitches that follow me?

[Pre-Chorus: Ali Tamposi & Cardi B]
My heart is beating like it's bleeding out
You sleepin', you sleepin', you sleepin'
You sleeping like a baby
Everyone was right about you now, and
You creepin', you creepin', you creepin'

[Chorus: Ali Tamposi & Cardi B]
I went through your phone last night
I went through your phone last night
Saw some things I didn't like
I went through your phone last night
It's killin' me, killin' me, killin' me, oh

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
All I can see is you and her in different scenarios
Beyoncé on my stereo, "Resentment" on repeat
I'ma make your bowl of cereal with a teaspoon of bleach
Serve it to you like, "Here you go, nigga, bon appétit"
Look, did you give it to her raw? You love her or nah?
You risk your whole home for a ho from the bar?
You really want them hoes? You can have them bitches
You don't even cheat with no badder bitches
This shit is eatin' me, you sleepin' peacefully
Gettin' more mad at you, thinkin' 'bout stabbin' you
Don't even know that you this close to dyin'
You gon' wake up like, "Why you got an attitude?"

[Pre-Chorus: Ali Tamposi & Cardi B]
My heart is beating like it's bleeding out
You sleepin', you sleepin', you sleepin'
You sleeping like a baby
Everyone was right about you now, and
You creepin', you creepin', you creepin'

[Chorus: Ali Tamposi & Cardi B]
I went through your phone last night
I went through your phone last night
Saw some things I didn't like

Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections, every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know

But nothing can compare to when you're naked
Now a Backwood and some Henny got you faded
Saying you the one for me, I need to face it

Swear to God that I loved her

Marry Me by Thomas Rhett

[Verse 1]
She wants to get married, she wants it perfect
She wants her granddaddy preaching the service
And she wants magnolias out in the country
Not too many people, save her daddy some money

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ooh, she got it all planned out
Yeah, I can see it all right now

[Chorus 1]
I'll wear my black suit, black tie, hide out in the back
I'll do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
But she don't wanna marry me

[Verse 2]
I remember the night when I almost kissed her
Yeah, I kinda freaked out, we've been friends for forever
And I'd always wonder if she felt the same way
When I got the invite, I knew it was too late

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I know her daddy's been dreading this day
Oh, but he don't know he ain't the only one giving her away

I'll wear my black suit, black tie, hide out in the back
I'll do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
But she don't wanna marry me

[Bridge]
Bet she got on her dress now, welcoming the guests now
I could try to find her, get it off of my chest now
But I ain't gonna mess it up, so I wish her the best now

[Chorus 2]
So I'm in my black suit, black tie, hiding out in the back
Doing a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask
I'll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees
Yeah, she wanna get married
Yeah, she gonna get married
But she ain't gonna marry me
Whoa, but she ain't gonna marry me, no

Lullaby by Sigala

[Verse 1]
Will you lay me down?
Make our hearts the only sound
Throw my fears all to the ground
Will you hold me?
Will you serenade me
With the song you used to play?
'Til the night turns into day
Will you hold me?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause all I need is somebody near me
When my heart gets weak
Somebody out there watching over me
When I'm so tired, I can't even sleep

[Chorus]
Won't you sing me your sweet lullaby?
Just the sound of your voice is the thing that I need
Won't you sing me your sweet lullaby?
I could fall for the sound of your sweet melody
'Cause I just need your song
Something to sing along
When I'm not feeling strong, I need you
To sing me your sweet lullaby
Need the sound of your sweet melody
So sing to me

[Post-Chorus]
So sing to me
Need the sound of your sweet melody
So sing to me

[Verse 2]
I'll be there when you're down
'Cause forever, I am bound
For my love, I shout it out
Let me hold you
No journey is too far
For the one who healed my scars
You're my saviour, you're my star
Let me hold you

'Cause all I need is somebody near me
When my heart gets weak
Somebody out there watching over me
When I'm so tired, I can't even sleep

Just the sound of your voice is the thing that I need
Won't you sing me your sweet lullaby?

When my heart stops beating, just sing to me
When I'm not sleeping, you're all I need and
When my heart stops beating, just sing to me
When I'm not sleeping, you're all I need and
Just sing to, sing to me
Can't you please sing to me?

[Chorus]
Won't you sing me your sweet lullaby?
Just the sound of your voice is the thing that I need
Won't you sing me your sweet lullaby?
I could fall for the sound of your sweet melody
'Cause I just need your song
Something to sing along
When I'm not feeling strong, I need you
To sing me your sweet lullaby
Need the sound of your sweet melody
So sing to me

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael

You stuck in the friend zone, I tell that four-five the fifth, ayy
Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit, ayy
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit, ayy
I made my first million, I'm like, "Shit, this is it," ayy
30 for a walkthrough, man, we had that bitch lit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'
And I'm like "Whoa, man, my neck so goddamn cold 
Diamonds wet, my t-shirt soaked
I got homies, let it go, oh
My money thick, won't ever fold
She said, "Can I have some to hold?"
And I can't ever tell you no

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you

My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you

It's fifty on the pinky, chain so stanky
You should see the whip, promise I can take yo' bitch
Dolla ridin' in an old school Chevy, it's a drop top
Boolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top
Just one switch, I can make the ass drop (Hey)
Ayy, take you to the smoke shop
We gon' get high, ayy, we gon' hit Rodeo
Dial up Valentino, we gon' hit Pico
Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums
This ain't happen overnight, no, these diamonds real bright
Saint Laurent jeans, still in my Vans though
All VVS', put you in a necklace
Girl, you look beautiful tonight
Stars on the roof, they matching with the jewelry

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Damn, my AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos
My AP goin' psycho, lil' mama bad like Michael
Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though

Cop another bag and smoke today
Cop another bag and smoke today
Cop another bag and smoke today
Cop another bag and smoke today
Cop another bag and smoke today
Cop another bag and smoke today
Cop another bag and smoke today
Cop another bag and smoke today

[Chorus: kiLL edward]
I got thoughts, can't control
Got me down, got me low
Rest my mind, rest my soul
When I blow, when I blow
Am I wrong, let them know
Feels so right to let things go
Don't think twice, this is me
This is how I should be

[Bridge: J. Cole]
But I'm aggravated without it
My saddest days are without it
My Saturdays are the loudest
I'm blowing strong
Some niggas graduated to powder
I dabble later, I doubt it
My database of narcotics
It's growing long
But I'm aggravated without it
My saddest days are without it
My Saturdays are the loudest
I'm blowing strong
Some niggas graduated to powder
I dabble later, I doubt it
My database of narcotics
It's growing long

[Verse: J. Cole]
I wrote this shit to talk about the word addiction
To my niggas --- I hope you listening
--- and ---, I hope you listening
This is for the whole fucking Ville, I hope you're listening
Smoking medical grade, but I ain't got prescription
All the way in Cali where they ain't got precipi-
-tation, feeling like the only one that made it
And I hate it for my niggas 'cause they ain't got ambition
Fuck did you expect, you can blame it on condition
Blame it on crack, you can blame it on the system
Blame it on the fact that 12 got jurisdiction
To ride around in neighborhoods that they ain't ever lived in
Blame it on the strain that you feel when daddy missing
Blame it on Trump shit, blame it on Clinton
Blame it on trap music and the politicians
Or the fact that every black boy wanna be Pippen
But they only got 12 slots on the Pistons
Blame it on the rain, Milli Vanilli with the disk skip
What I'm tryna say is the blame can go deep as seas
Just to blame 'em all I would need like twenty CD's
There's all sorts of trauma from drama that children see
Type of shit that normally would call for therapy
But you know just how it go in our community
Keep that shit inside it don't matter how hard it be
Fast forward, them kids is grown and they blowing trees
And popping pills due to chronic anxiety
I been saw the problem but stay silent 'cause I ain't Jesus
This ain't no trial if you desire go higher please
But fuck that now I'm older I love you 'cause you my friend
Without the drugs I want you be comfortable in your skin
I know you so I know you still keep a lot of shit in
You running from yourself and you buying product again
I know you say it helps and no I'm not trying to offend
But I know depression and drug addiction don't blend
Reality distorts and then you get lost in the wind
And I done seen the combo take niggas off the deep end
One thing about your demons they bound to catch up one day
I'd rather see you stand up and face them than run away
I understand this message is not the coolest to say
But if you down to try it I know of a better way
Meditate

[Pre-Chorus: J. Cole]
Meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate
Don't medicate, medicate, don't medicate, medicate
Meditate, meditate, meditate, meditate
Don't medicate, medicate, don't medicate, medicate

[Chorus: kiLL edward]
I got thoughts, can't control
Got me down, got me low
Rest my mind, rest my soul
When I blow, when I blow
Am I wrong, let them know
Feels so right to let things go
Don't think twice, this is me
This is how I should be

Once an Addict - Interlude by J. Cole

[Intro]
Right, right, right, right
Something's got a hold on me
Right, right, right, right
Sometimes I think pain is just a lack of understanding
If we could only understand it all, would we feel no pain?
God must feel no pain
Something's got a hold on me
Only joy
Does this mean even our suffering pleases him?

[Verse]
Lost in a cloud of marijuana
Young Carolina nigga, fish out of water
Step-daddy just had a daughter with another woman
Mama ain't recover yet
Callin' me at 12 at night
She drunk as fuck and I'm upset
'Cause why she always using me for crutch?
Growin' up I used to always see her up
Late as shit, cigarette smoke and greatest hits from Marvin Gaye
She kill a whole bottle of some cheap chardonnay
I gotta leave this house 'cause part of me dies when I see her like this
Too young to deal with pain
I'd rather run the streets than see her kill herself
So 'Ville became my escape from a feelin' I hate
Mama cursing me out
Depression's such a villainous state
I used to stay out later on purpose
Subconsciously I was nervous that if I came home early then what would surface was her inner demons
And then I'd have to end up seein' my hero on ground zero
Tears flow while Al Green blow
Love and happiness
I wish that I could say the right words to cheer her up
I wish her son's love was enough
I tell her, "Mama, go to sleep"
She tell me "Boy, hush. You better pray to God you never get your heart crushed"
I shake my head in frustration
Head to my room and I can still hear the tunes with my door shut
Fuck it though, a couple more months I'll be gone
Off to college and dorms
Foolin' myself, thinkin' problems are gone
But now it's 1 AM and my mama dialin' my phone
I know she intoxicated and soon this high that I'm on comes crashin' down
She lit, talkin' drunk shit, I'm pissed
But I'm still all ears like Basset Hounds
Thinkin' to myself, "Maybe my mama need help
Don't she got work in the morning?
Why she do this to herself?
Hate how she slurrin' her words
Soundin' so fuckin' absurd
This ain't the woman I know, why I just sit and observe?
Why don't I say how I feel?
When I do, she's defensive for real
Well maybe things get better with time, I heard it heals
Little did I know how deep her sadness would go
Lookin' back, I wish I woulda did more instead of runnin'

[Outro]
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be free
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be 
No!
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Right
Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain (right)
Choose wisely (right)

Intro by J. Cole

[Produced by J. Cole]

[Verse 1]
Partially functional, half of me is comfortable
The other half is close to the cliff like Mrs. Huxtable
These boys got them hoslters and clips they pack like Lunchables
Like white boys in grade school, while we ate school made food
Just eyeing they shit, wish I was trying they shit
Knowing when mama hit the store she wasn t buying that shit
No I ain't crying a bit man, that's just life that's how that shit work
You reach your hand in fire, you pull it back when you get burnt
Gotta learn when you get hurt, even if it's with cupid
He beat you and you went back, who's officially stupid?
Oh yeah I understand that's your man, you had a plan
You been together for some years, you sticking with him for the kids
So you overlook the tears, but we both know that's a bad look
'Cause 20 years from now your daughter probably get her ass whooped
Look, if this too deep for the intro I ll find another use
But just in case its perfect let me introduce
Cole

[Hook: Erykah Badu]
Time to save the world, bearing the world is all the time
So many things I still don't know, so many times I've changed my mind
Guess I was born to make mistakes, but I ain't scared to take the weight
So when I stumble off the path, I know my heart will guide me back

[Verse 2]
Yea, man, is this too deep for the intro? If so I ll find another use
But just in case its perfect, let me introduce
It s Cole, I had a dream and so I made a move
A ill ass nigga who just so happened to stay in school
Still rap for hustlers and mothafuckers that hated school
Said "that's for busters," then heard my shit and I made it cool
It's safe to say that I m gifted as if I m Christmas shopping
I got gangsta niggas lining up in admissions office
Ayy, possibly cause all the hoes a nigga scraped
A lot of shit up on my plate so you know a nigga late to my first class
I d much rather sit up in first class
Should I admit that a slutty bitch was my first smash?
Wasn't experienced, so nah I didn't wear it out
Always thought my first time would be someone I cared about
But being a virgin was something to be embarrassed 'bout
I used that ass for practice, so I wasn't scared out my mind
You call it rhymes I call it clearing out my mind
Was just a young boy starin' out my blinds
Till I got free from my mama leash
Running loose through the streets
Like a stray dog in heat
And we looking for some freaks can you play, pardon me
Whats your name, don t mistake me for no lame, no not me
She knew I was on the team cause she seen how tall I be
In the club dappin  niggas, even-tu-ally R-I-P
Damn, you win some, you lose some, that just how its happens
And if a nigga step up to ya, then you gotta scrap em
Your name is all you got, throwing hands by the bathroom
Its funny I barely told nobody I started rapping
'Cause see some niggas was haters that I just viewed as clowns
At 14 I knew I was the nicest dude around
I gotta make a move, I gotta do this now
If they don t know your dreams, then they can't shoot em down

[Interlude]
Ha, yeah nigga
Hell yeah, I felt that one in my fuckin' soul

[Outro: Erykah Badu]
Ooh, hey, I'm trying to decide
Which way to go, think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere
Ooh, hey, I'm trying to decide
Which way to go, think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere

2002 by Anne-Marie

[Verse 1]
I will always remember
The day you kissed my lips
Light as a feather
And it went just like this
No, it's never been better
Than the summer of 2002 (ooh)
Uh, we were only 11
But acting like grown-ups
Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing, "Love is forever and ever"
Well, I guess that was true

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say

[Chorus]
Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young, uh
Singing at the top of both our lungs

[Verse 2]
Now we're under the covers
Fast forward to eighteen
We are more than lovers
Yeah, we are all we need
When we're holding each other
I'm taken back to 2002 (ooh)
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say

[Chorus]
Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young, uh
Singing at the top of both our lungs
On the day we fell in love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
On the day we fell in love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
Oh, now

[Chorus]
Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young, uh
Singing at the top of both our lungs
On the day we fell in love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
On the day we fell in love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
On the day we fell in love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
On the day we fell in love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
On the day we fell in love, love, love

Broken Arrows by Avicii

[Verse 1]
You stripped your love down to the wire
Fire shy and cold alone outside
You stripped it right down to the wire
But I see you behind those tired eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Now as you wade through shadows that live in your heart
You'll find the light that leads home
Cause I see you for you and your beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go

[Chorus]
Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
But I, I see the hope in your heart

[Verse 2]
I've seen the darkness in the light
The kind of blue that leaves you lost and blind
The only thing that's black and white
Is that you don't have to walk alone this time

[Pre-Chorus]
We have to tear down walls that live in your heart
To find someone you call home
Now you see me for me and my beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go

[Chorus]
Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
But I, I see the hope in your heart

[Outro]
It's not too late, it's not too late
I see the hope in your heart
Sometimes losing, sometimes shooting
Broken arrows in the dark

For A Better Day by Avicii

[Verse 1]
Paint on a caution wind
Meet the bleeding sky
I called your name
There was no one there
And in the cold and snow
I saw your face

[Chorus]
And we sang the song for the little things
Magic call, but the joy you bring
Running it down the line
Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing
Magic call from a pretty thing
Maybe it might be time
For a better day
For a better day

[Verse 2]
Straight, from the path of love
In the road of life
I tumble forward
But going on, I'mma keep it strong
I saw your face

[Chorus]
And we sang the song for the little thing
Magic call, but the joy you bring
Running it down the line
Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing
Magic call from a pretty thing
Maybe it might be time
For a better day
For a better day
For a better day
For a better day
For a better day

The Days by Avicii

[Verse 1: Avicii & Robbie Williams]
Under the tree where the grass don't grow
We made a promise to never get old
You had a chance and you took it on me
And I made a promise that I couldn't keep

[Pre-Chorus: Avicii & Robbie Williams]
Heartache, heartbreaks all over town
But something flipped like a switch when you came around
And I'm in pieces, pick me up and put me together
(Oh whoa oh)

[Chorus 1: Avicii & Robbie Williams]
These are the days we've been waiting for
On days like these who could ask for more
Keep them coming 'cause we're not done yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget
These are the days we've been waiting for
Rattle the cage and slam that door
And the world is calling us but not just yet
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we won't forget

[Verse 2: Avicii & Robbie Williams]
Out on the midnight the wild ones howl
The last of the lost boys have thrown in the towel
We used to believe we were stars aligned
You made a wish and I fell out of

[Pre-Chorus: Avicii & Robbie Williams]
Time flew, cut through all over town
You made me bleed when I look up and you're not around
But I'm in pieces, pick me up and put me together
(Oh whoa oh)

[Chorus 2: Avicii & Robbie Williams]
These are the days we've been waiting for
Neither of us knows what's in store
You just roll your window down and place your bets
These are the days we won't regret
These are the days we'll never forget
And these are the days (these are the days)
And these are the days (these are the days)

Everybody Hates Me by The Chainsmokers

[Intro]
Yeah, let's do it again but, uh, this time, uh, let's go full psycho

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I just wanna drink tequila with my friend
She says she cheated 'cause she's tryna get ahead
The more I read it, yeah, the more I take offense
I'm so defeated, I can't get outside my head
I post a picture of myself 'cause I'm lonely
Everyone knows what I look like
Not even one of them knows me
Yeah, I just wanna drink tequila with my friends
I'm so defeated, I just want this shit to end

[Chorus]
So I walk into the club like everybody hates me
I walk into the club like everybody hates me
I'm talkin' to myself, shit, now they think I'm crazy
I walk into the club like everybody hates me (Everybody hates me)
Like everybody hates me

[Drop]
Like everybody hates me (Everybody, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I'm a product of the internet
And now, I'm face to face with all the voices in my head
I can't even check the time without facing regret
Why do I still have to mean everything I ever said?
And I'm not tryna be like, "Poor me," I made it
I'm just trying to stay normal now that they know what my name is
Yeah, I just wanna drink tequila with my friends
Yeah, they're the reason that I still am who I am

[Chorus]
So I walk into the club like everybody hates me
I walk into the club like everybody hates me
I'm talkin' to myself, shit, now they think I'm crazy
I walk into the club like everybody hates me (Everybody hates me)
Like everybody hates me

Like everybody, everybody hates me (Everybody, yeah)

I Could Be The One (Avicii Vs. Nicky Romero) - Nicktim / Radio Edit by Avicii

Do you think about me when you're all alone?
The things we used to do we used to be
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

Do you think about me when the crowd is gone?
It used to be so easy, you and me
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

When you need a way to beat the pressure down
When you need to find a way to breathe
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

If you need to see me when the crowd is gone
It used to be so easy can't you see?
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free 

I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free
I could be the one to make you feel that way
I could be the one to set you free

Addicted To You by Avicii

[Verse 1]
I don't know just how it happened; I let down my guard
Swore I'd never fall in love again, but I fell hard
Guess I should have seen it coming; caught me by surprise
Wasn't looking where I was going; I fell into your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
You came into my crazy world like a cool and cleansing rain
Before I, I knew what hit me, baby, you were flowing through my veins

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of
Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue
I'm out of control, what can I do?
I'm addicted to you

[Verse 2]
Midnight blows in through the window, dances 'round the room
Got me hypnotised, I'm getting high on love with you
I couldn't live without you now, oh, I know I'd go insane
I wouldn't last one night alone, baby
I couldn't stand the pain

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of
Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue
Out of control, what can I do?
I'm  addicted to you

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
C-L-O-S-E (ooh)
You're so C-L-O-S-E to me (you know)
C-L-O-S-E to me (you made me do)
I mean, seriously, can I breathe? (Ooh)
C-L-O-S-E (through it)
You're so C-L-O-S-E to me (through it)
You're too C-L-O-S-E to me (you're too close)
You're so C-L-O-S-E (you're so close)

Silhouettes - Original Radio Edit by Avicii

Press play, fast forward
Non stop we have the beaten path before us
It was all there, in plain sight
Come on people, we have all seen the sunshine
We will never get back to
To the old school
To the old rounds, it's all about the newfound
We are the newborn, the world know all abouts
(We are the future and we're here to stay)
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, at the faded silhouette

Straight ahead on the path we have before us
Day by day, soon the change will come
Don't you know we took a big step forward
Just lead the way and we pull the trigger
And we will never get back to
To the old school
To the old grounds, it's all about the newfound
We are the newborn, the world know all about us
(We are the future and we're here to stay)

We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back,  look back at the faded silhouette

Is she the one?
The one you've been waiting for?

No, I shouldn't mind
All I think about is

Ye vs. the People (starring TI as the People) by Kanye West

[Intro: Four Tops]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I had for us
You turned my dreams into dust
I watch a phone that I had for us
You turned my dreams into dust

[Verse: Kanye West & T.I.]
I know Obama was heaven-sent
But ever since Trump won, it proved that I could be president
Yeah, you can, at what cost though?
Don't that go against the teachings that Ye taught for?
Yo, Tip, I hear your side and everybody talk though
But ain't goin' against the grain everything I fought for?
Prolly so, Ye, but where you tryna go with this?
It's some shit you just don't align with and don't go against
You just readin' the headlines, you don't see the fine print
You on some choosin'-side shit, I'm on some unified shit
It's bigger than your selfish agenda
If your election ain't gon' stop police from murderin' niggas
Then shit 
Bruh, I never ever stopped fightin' for the people
Actually, wearin' the hat'll show people that we equal
You gotta see the vantage point of the people
What makes you feel equal makes them feel evil
See that's the problem with this damn nation
All Blacks gotta be Democrats, man
We ain't made it off the plantation
Fuck who you choose as your political party
You representin' dudes just seem crude and cold-hearted
With blatant disregard for the people who put you in position
Don't you feel an obligation to them?
I feel a obligation to show people new ideas
And if you wanna hear 'em, there go two right here
Make America Great Again had a negative perception
I took it, wore it, rocked it, gave it a new direction
Added empathy, care and love and affection
And y'all simply questionin' my methods
What you willin' to lose for the point to be proved?
This shit is stubborn, selfish, bullheaded, even for you
You wore a dusty-ass hat to represent the same views
As white supremacy, man, we expect better from you
All them times you sounded crazy, we defended you, homie
Not just to be let down when we depend on you, homie
That's why it's important to know what direction you're goin' now
'Cause everything that you built can be destroyed and torn down
You think I ain't concerned about how I affect the past?
I mean, that hat stayed in my closet like 'bout a year and a half
Then one day I was like, "Fuck it, I'ma do me."
I was in the sunken place and then I found the new me
Not worried about some image that I gotta keep up
Lot of people agree with me, but they're too scared to speak up
The greater good of the people is first
Have you considered all the damage and the people you hurt?
You had a bad idea and you're makin' it worse
This shit's just as bad as Catholic preachers rapin' in church
Y'all been leadin' with hate, see I just approach it different
Like a gang truce, the first Blood to shake the Crip's hand
I know everybody emotional
Is it better if I rap about crack? Huh? 'Cause it's cultural?
Or how about I'ma shoot you? Or fuck your bitch?
Or how about all this Gucci, 'cause I'm fuckin' rich?
You'll deal with God for the lack of respect
Startin' to make it seem like Donnie cut you a check
Now you toyin' with hot lava, better be careful with that
What's it mean to gain the world if you ain't standin' for shit?
Okay I gotta say it, Ye, you sound high as a bigot
Yeah, genocide and slavery, we should just try and forget
And all that free thought shit, find a better defense
But if Ye just stuck in his way, he can leave it at that
Fuck it

[Outro: Kanye West]
Alright, Tip, we could be rappin' about this all day, man
Why don't we just cut the beat off and let the people talk?

[Intro: Swae Lee]
30, you a fool for this one
Oh, C-L-O-S-E
Ear Drummers
Mike WiLL Made-It

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
One rope in the chain, yeah, lightin' propane, yeah
Dousin' the flame, yeah, bounce for some change, yeah
Gang can't be tamed, yeah, ice in our veins, yeah
Somethin' feels strange, this cup is dangerous
Somethin' ain't right, dawg (yeah), we in too easy (yeah)
Been here all night, dawg, really, I'm tweakin', yeah (it's lit)
Lookin' to pipe some, ass in the party, look like a pageant (pop it)
If we gon' fight some, beat it and dash it, lawyer do magic (alright)

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
Love right up my avenue (ooh) but that s just not up my avenue (no)
You cried and said, "Look what you made me do" (you made me do)
It's not my fault that I don't wanna end up screwed (ooh)
And everything I'm tryna say, you beat me to it (to it)
And all the ups and all the downs, we have been through it (through it)
Now you're C-L-O-S-E (you're too close), you're too C-L-O-S-E to me (you're so close)

[Chorus: Swae Lee & Slim Jxmmi]
C-L-O-S-E (it's ruined)
You're so C-L-O-S-E to me
C-L-O-S-E to me (it's ruined)
I mean, seriously, can I breathe?
C-L-O-S-E
You're so C-L-O-S-E to me
You're too C-L-O-S-E to me (yeah, C-L-O-S-E)
You're so C-L-O-S-E (yeah) (Jxm, ayy)

[Verse 3: Slim Jxmmi]
You know I'm a dog and I can't control it (dog)
Wanna settle someday but not at the moment (wanna settle someday)
I'ma stack up the cake like Obama told me (gotta stack up the cake)
Niggas smile in your face and they're not your homie (too close)
Makin' me claustrophobic (claustrophobic), bust down the AP and wet the Rollie (bust it down)
Stop callin' me "brother," you barely know me (I'm not your bro)
Don't tell me you love me, you gotta show me (don't tell me you love me)
I'm so anti (Jxm), gotta get paid to go outside (woo)
Blowin' on the strong like "How High" (blowin' on strong)
Haters still watch from the sideline (haters still watchin')
Sremm and La Flame on the incline (incline)
Mixin' up brands, it's drip time (drip)
Stuck to the plan, had to get mine (get mine)
Stayed down and it paid off big time

[Bridge: Swae Lee]
So many, so many drugs
You only get so many, so many tries
So many, so many tries
You only get so many, so many tries
So many, so many tries
You only get so many, so many tries
So many, so many tries
You only get so many, so many tries

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
C-L-O-S-E (ooh)
You're so C-L-O-S-E to me (you know)
C-L-O-S-E to me (you made me do)
I mean, seriously, can I breathe? (Ooh)
C-L-O-S-E (through it)
You're so C-L-O-S-E to me (through it)
You're too C-L-O-S-E to me (you're too close)
You're so C-L-O-S-E (you're so close)

Hunger by Florence The Machine

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
At seventeen I started to starve myself
I thought that love was a kind of emptiness
And at least I understood then the hunger I felt
And I didn't have to call it loneliness

[Chorus]
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what you need
Oh, you look so free
The way you use your body, baby
Come on and work it for me
Don't let them get you down
You're the best thing I've seen
We never found the answer
But we knew one thing

[Chorus]
We all have a hunger
(We all have a hunger)
We all have a hunger
(We all have a hunger)
We all have a hunger
(We all have a hunger)
We all have a hunger
(We all have a hunger)

[Post-Chorus]
And it's Friday night and it's kicking in
In that pink dress, they're gonna crucify me
Oh and you in all your vibrant youth
How could anything bad ever happen to you?
You make a fool of death with your beauty
And for a moment

[Verse 2]
I thought that love was in the drugs
But the more I took, the more it took away
And I could never get enough
I thought that love was on the stage, give yourself to strangers
You don't have to be afraid
Then it tries to find a home
With people or when I'm alone
Picking it apart
And staring at your phone

[Chorus]
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger
We all have a hunger

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what you need
Oh, you look so free
The way you use your body, baby
Come on and work it for me
Don't let them get you down
You're the best thing I've seen
We never found the answer
But we knew one thing

[Chorus]
We all have a hunger
(We all have a hunger)
We all have a hunger
(We all have a hunger)
We all have a hunger
(We all have a hunger)
We all have a hunger
(We all have a hunger)

[Post-Chorus]
And it's Friday night and it's kicking in
In that pink dress, they're gonna crucify me
Oh and you in all your vibrant youth
How could anything bad ever happen to you?
You make a fool of death with your beauty
And for a moment I forget to worry

Bloom by Troye Sivan

[Verse 1]
Take a trip into my garden
I've got so much to show ya
The fountains and the waters
Are begging just to know ya

[Refrain]
And it's true, baby
I've been saving this for you, baby

Now it's the perfect season
Yeah, let's go for it this time
We're dancing with the trees and
I've waited my whole life

[Refrain]
It's true, baby
I've been saving this for you, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you to
Tell me right before it goes down
Promise me you'll
Hold my hand if I get scared now
Might tell you to
Take a second, baby, slow it down
You should know I, you should know I

[Chorus]
(Yeah I bloom) I bloom just for you
(I bloom) just for you
(Yeah I bloom) I bloom just for you

Just for you

I bloom just for you
Baby, baby, I've been saving this for you, baby
Baby, baby, I've been saving this for you, baby

[Chorus]

Come on, baby, play me like a love song

Four Out Of Five by Arctic Monkeys

[Verse 1]
Advertise in imaginative ways, start your free trial today
Come on in, the water's lovely
Look, you could meet someone you like
During the meteor strike, it is that easy
Lunar surface on a Saturday night, dressed up in silver and white
With coloured Old Grey Whistle Test lights

[Chorus]
Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us, it s such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
Since the exodus, it's all getting gentrified
I put a taqueria on the roof, it was well reviewed
Four stars out of five
And that's unheard of

[Verse 2]
Mr. Bridge and Tunnel on the Starlight Express
The head of special effects in my mind s eye
Hokey Cokey with the opposite sex
The things you try to forget, doesn't time fly?
I'm in no position to give advice, I don't want to be nice
And you know that

[Chorus]
Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us, it's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
Around Clavius, it's all getting gentrified
The Information-Action Ratio is the place to go
And you will not recognise the old headquarters

[Bridge]
All the nights that never happened and the days that don't exist
At the Information-Action Ratio
The only time that we stop laughing is to breathe or steal a kiss
I can get you on the list for all the clubs
I can lift you up another semitone

[Chorus]
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, it's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
(Cute new places keep on popping up)
Since the exodus, it s all getting gentrified
The Information-Action Ratio (The Information-Action Ratio)
Is the place to go, four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, now, it s such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
(Cute new places keep on popping up)
Around Clavius, it's all getting gentrified
I put a taqueria on the moon (The Information-Action Ratio)
It got rave reviews, four stars out of five

[Outro]
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, four stars out of five
(Take it easy for a little while)
Four stars out of five

Star Treatment by Arctic Monkeys

[Verse 1]
I just wanted to be one of The Strokes
Now look at the mess you made me make
Hitchhiking with a monogrammed suitcase
Miles away from any half-useful imaginary highway
I'm a big name in deep space, ask your mates
But golden boy's in bad shape
I found out the hard way that
Here ain't no place for dolls like you and me
Everybody's on a barge
Floating down the endless stream of great TV
1984, 2019

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Maybe I was a little too wild in the '70s
Rocket-ship grease down the cracks of my knuckles
Karate bandana, warp speed chic
Hair down to there, impressive moustache
Love came in a bottle with a twist-off cap
Let's all have a swig and do a hot lap

[Chorus]
So who you gonna call?
The Martini Police
Baby, that isn't how they look tonight, oh no
It took the light forever to get to your eyes

[Verse 2]
I just wanted to be one of those ghosts
You thought that you could forget
And then I haunt you via the rear view mirror
On a long drive from the back seat
But it's alright, 'cause you love me
And you recognise that it ain't how it should be
Your eyes are heavy and the weather's getting ugly
So pull over, I know the place
Don't you know an apparition is a cheap date?
What exactly is it you've been drinking these days?
Jukebox in the corner, "Long Hot Summer"
They've got a film up on the wall and it's dark enough to dance
What do you mean you've never seen Blade Runner?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, maybe I was a little too wild in the '70s
Back down to earth with a lounge singer shimmer
Elevator down to my make-believe residency
From the honeymoon suite
Two shows a day, four nights a week
Easy money

[Chorus]
So who you gonna call?
The Martini Police
So who you gonna call?
The Martini Police
Oh, baby, that isn't how they look tonight
It took the light absolutely forever to get to your eyes

[Outro]
And as we gaze skyward, ain't it dark early?
It's the star treatment
Yeah, and as we gaze skyward, ain't it dark early?
It's the star treatment
It's the star treatment
The star treatment

One Point Perspective by Arctic Monkeys

[Verse 1]
Dancing in my underpants
I'm gonna run for government
I'm gonna form a covers band anorl (stop)
Back there by the baby grand, did Mr. Winter Wonderland say
"Come 'ere, kid, we really need to talk"?
Bear with me, man, I lost my train of thought

[Verse 2]
I fantasise, I call it quits, I swim with the economists
And I get to the bottom of it for good
By the time reality hits, the chimes of freedom fell to bits
The shining city on the fritz
They come out of the cracks, thirsty for blood (stop)

[Bridge]
Oh, just as the apocalypse finally gets prioritised
And you cry some of the hottest tears you ever cried
Multiplied by five
I suppose a singer must die

[Verse 3]
"Singsong 'Round the Money Tree"
This stunning documentary that no one else unfortunately saw
Such beautiful photography, it's worth it for the opening scene
I've been driving 'round listening to the score
Or maybe I just imagined it all
I've played to quiet rooms like this before
Bear with me, man, I lost my train of thought

Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino by Arctic Monkeys

[Verse 1]
Jesus in the day spa, filling out the information form
Mama got her hair done, just popping out to sing a protest song
I've been on a bender back to that prophetic esplanade
Where I ponder all the questions but just manage to miss the mark

[Chorus]
Hoo
Good afternoon
Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino
Mark speaking
Please, tell me, how may I direct your call?

[Verse 2]
This magical thinking feels as if it really might catch on
Mama wants some answers
Do you remember where it all went wrong?
Technological advances really bloody get me in the mood
Pull me in close on a crisp eve, baby
Kiss me underneath the moon's side boob

[Chorus]
Good afternoon
Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino
Mark speaking
Please, tell me, how may I direct your call?

[Bridge]
And do you celebrate your dark side
Then wish you'd never left the house?
Have you ever spent a generation trying to figure that one out?

[Chorus]
Hoo
Good afternoon
Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino
Mark speaking
Please, tell me, how may I direct your call?

Yes Indeed by Lil Baby

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah
Wheezy outta here

[Verse 1: Drake]
The dash, it's digi', the schedule busy
My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, "Look up" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like: "Yes, indeed"

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Cartier glasses, I won't even peek at you
Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu
I got 'em waitin' and watchin' what he gon' do
Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves
25 hundred for a new pair of tennis shoes
The same price, I could make them youngins come and finish you
Lawyer been chargin', he a Jewish like he voodoo
Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout what he do
I'm gettin' money like I'm from the '80s
Me and Drake 'bout to drop man, this shit gon' go crazy
They know I'm the truth, comin' straight from the basement
I'm straight as the street, man I come from the pavement
A million, all hundreds, it make 'em 'go crazy
Wah-wah-wah, bitch I'm the baby

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like: "Yes, indeed"
Me and my dawg goin' all the way
When you livin' like this, they supposed to hate
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like: "Yes, indeed"
Me and my dawg goin' all the way
When you livin' like this, they supposed to hate

Enviyon on the mix
No, no, no, no
No-no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Verse]
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heart break

[Bridge]
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (Were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?)

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Outro]
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
Easier said than done, I thought you were...
...instead of my head
You found another...
...better one
I won't let you forget me

American Sports by Arctic Monkeys

[Verse 1]
So when you gaze at planet Earth from outer space
Does it wipe that stupid look off of your face?
I saw this aura over the battleground states
I lost the money, lost the keys
But I'm still handcuffed to the briefcase

[Chorus]
And I never thought, not in a million year
That I'd meet so many Lola's
Can I please have my money back?
My virtual reality mask is stuck on  Parliament Brawl 
Emergency battery pack, just in time for my weekly chat
With God on videocall

[Verse 2]
Breaking news, they take the truth and make it fluid
The trainer's explanation was accepted by the steward
A montage of the latest ancient ruins
Soundtracked by a chorus of "You don't know what you're doing"

[Chorus]
And I never thought, not in a million years
That I'd meet so many Lola's

[Bridge]
And all of my most muscular regrets
Explode behind my eyes like American sports
Hoo

[Chorus]
And I never thought, not in a million year
That I'd meet so many Lola's

All Girls Are The Same by Juice WRLD

[Intro]
They're rotting my brain, love
These hoes are the same

[Verse 1]
I admit it, another ho got me finished
Broke my heart, oh no you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'ma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth, can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman, tell me she from Colorado
And she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'?
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in, I don't fit in
Tell me what's the secret to love, I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today, and she grinnin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, these girls are insane

[Chorus]
All girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change, before I go insane, love
All girls are the same, they're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change, before I go insane, love

[Verse 2]
Ten minutes, she told me it would take ten minutes
To break my heart, oh no she didn't
Fuck livin', I'ma drown in my sorrow
Fuck givin', I'ma take not borrow
And I'm still sinnin', I'm still losin' my mind
I know I been trippin', I'm still wastin' my time
All the time given, am I dyin'? Am I livin'?
It's fuck feelings, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'

[Chorus]
Now I am insane, demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't attain, 'cause all these girls the same, love
Now I am insane, demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't attain, 'cause all these girls the same, love

I'm not your toy, not your toy, not your toy, not your toy, toy
I'm not your toy, not your toy, not your toy, toy

Golden Trunks by Arctic Monkeys

[Verse 1]
Last night when my psyche's
Subcommittee sang to me in its scary voice
You slowly dropped your eyelids
When true love takes a grip, it leaves you without a choice

[Chorus]
And in response to what you whispered in my ear
I must admit, sometimes I fantasise about you too

[Verse 2]
The leader of the free world
Reminds you of a wrestler wearing tight golden trunks
He's got him sen a theme tune
They play it for him as he makes his way to the ring

[Chorus]
And in response to what you whispered in my ear
I must admit, sometimes I fantasise about you too

[Bridge]
In the daytime
Bendable figures with a fresh new pack of lies
Summat else to publicise
I'm sure you've heard about enough

[Chorus]
So in response to what you whispered in my ear
I'll be upfront, sometimes I fantasise about you too

I've got a laser guiding my love that I cannot adjust

Forward-thinking model villages
More brain shrinking moving images
You push the button and we'll do the rest

Science Fiction by Arctic Monkeys

[Verse 1]
Religious iconography giving you the creeps?
I feel rougher than a disco lizard tongue along your cheek
The rise of the machines
I must admit you gave me something momentarily
In which I could believe
But the hand of harsh reality's un-gloved
And it's on its way back here to scoop you up
But not on my watch

[Chorus]
I want to stay with you, my love
The way some science fiction does

[Verse 2]
Reflections in the silver screen of strange societies
Swamp monster with a hard-on for connectivity
The ascension of the C.R.E.A.M
Mass panic on a not too distant future colony
Quantitative easing
I want to make a simple point about peace and love
But in a sexy way where it's not obvious
Highlight dangers and send out hidden messages

[Chorus]
The way some science fiction does
The way some science fiction does

[Bridge]
Got the world on a wire
In my little mirror, mirror on the wall
In the pocket of my raincoat

[Outro]
So I tried to write a song to make you blush
But I've a feeling that the whole thing
May well just end up too clever for its own good
The way some science fiction does

Where Were You In The Morning? by Shawn Mendes

[Verse 1]
You said, "I wanna get to know ya"
Why you gotta get my hopes up?
You said that you were staying over
But then I woke up to the cold air

[Refrain]
How could you make me believe?
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
I look around and I don't see you

[Chorus]
Where were you in the morning, baby?
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waitin'
Where were you in the morning, baby?

[Post-Chorus]
How do you, how do you just walk away?
How do you, how do you just walk away?

[Verse 2]
And I thought you really felt this
When we were talking about breakfast
You made it seem like we connected
I guess I just didn't expect this

[Refrain]
How could you make me believe?
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
I look around and I don't see you

[Chorus]
Where were you in the morning, baby?
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waitin'
I said where were you in the morning, baby?

[Post-Chorus]
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?

[Bridge]
And I hope you had a good reason
'Cause I know you had a good time
And I'm looking up at the ceiling
And I keep wondering why

[Chorus]
Where were you in the morning, baby?
Where were you in the morning?
You didn't leave your number for me
You didn't leave your number
Left me without a warning, waitin'
Left me without a warning
I said, where were you in the morning baby?
Where were you in the morning?

[Post-Chorus]
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where  were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?

The Night We Met by Lord Huron

[Verse 1]
I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met

[Verse 2]
And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

[Chorus]
I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Oh, take me back to the night we met

[Verse 3]
When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met

[Chorus]
I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met

On Yams and that's word to my moms
Margiela Madman with cases I'm still tryna beat
A bunch of shit from a long time ago
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
Like dominos, nigga, Geronimos
When it's my time to go
Flacko no Dominicano but eat the tostones with
Dealing with life and its highs and lows
I'm just pimpin' like I'm supposed
I guess it's called livin', shit, I suppose
I'm on my live alone, die VLONE
Ain't talkin' 'bout spending or buyin' clothes
I'm 'bout my business but I'm alone
I still had the vision when I was broke
Fuckin' on bitches and foreign hoes
Flyin' out womens to boring shows
I pray to God I don't overdose

[Pre-Chorus: A$AP Rocky with Kid Cudi]
I put A$AP on my tat (Woo)

They robbin' boys for the chains (Woo)
I got Goyard by the sack (Woo)
I got the boof by the pack (Woo)
I fucked your boo on her back

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky with Kid Cudi]
Gang! Gang! Them boys not flexing the same
I'm done with adjusting to fame, pull up on your set, leave a stain
Gang! Gang! I tell her come fuck with the gang
I tell 'em don't fuck with the gang, it's time to fuck up the whole game!
Hmm

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
I'm free as a bird, I wanted this shit my whole life
But had all this stress on my mind
Until I realized, things pan out when it's right
In the meantime I'ma grind
I think of them days when I was so young on my plight
Party and bullshit and play
Was up in the city, the one that's surrounded by lights
Wanted to burn it away
Get out of his lane, got no time, don't need no advice
Except for my momma
Ride for my daughter, she's all I need
She got her father, as I grow
Hell yeah, I did it, I'm on a roll
Thought I'd be up with my nigga, no
I'm just gettin' warmed up, let's start the show
I'm schoolin' these niggas, so in the zone and I'm rigged to blow
A$AP and Cud Life forever though
And I'm flossin' and bossin' these silly hoes
Learned the codes, serve up the magic for all of those
Kids that ain't had someone on they own
Hang on the words, you each have your song
Grab on and hold on, won't steer you wrong
Sing along, sing along, hmm

[Pre-Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
I put A$AP on my tat (Woo)
I put New York on the map (Woo)
I put the gang on the flames (Woo)
They gon' remember the name
They robbin' boys for the chains (Woo)
I got Goyard by the sack (Woo)
I got the boof by the pack (Woo)
I fucked your boo on her back (Woo)

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Gang! Gang! Them boys not flexing the same
I'm done with adjusting to fame, pull up on your set, leave a stain
Gang! Gang! I tell her come fuck with the gang
I tell 'em don't fuck with the gang, it's time to fuck up the whole game!
(Game, game, game, game)

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky & Khloe Anna]
Gang, gang
They tryna front on the gang, they gon' remember my name
True to truth somehow (Gang, gang)
But never truly lied at all, then and now
They tryna front on the gang
Truth somehow
Gang, A$AP boys come with the flame
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now

[Outro: Khloe Anna & Moby]
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
In my dreams, I'm dying all the time
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all
Then I wake, it's kaleidoscopic mind
But never truly lied at all
But never truly lied at all, then and now
I never meant to hurt you (Then and now)
I never meant to lie

Fallin' All In You by Shawn Mendes

[Verse 1]
Sunrise with you on my chest
No blinds in the place where I live
Daybreak open your eyes
'Cause this was only ever meant to be for one night
Still, we're changing our minds here
Be yours, be my dear
So close with you on my lips
Touch noses, feeling your breath
Push your heart and pull away, yeah
Be my summer in a winter day, love
I can't see one thing wrong
Between the both of us
Be mine, be mine, yeah
Anytime, anytime

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you know I've been alone for quite a while, haven't I
I thought I knew it all
Found love but I was wrong
More times than enough
But since you came along
I'm thinking, baby

[Chorus]
You, are bringing out a different kind of me (yeah)
There's no safety net that's underneath
I'm free
Fallin  all in you
Fell for men who weren't how they appear (yeah)
Trapped up on a tightrope now we're here
We're free
Fallin  all in you

[Verse 2]
Fast forward a couple years, yeah
Grown up in the place that we live
Make love, then we fight
Laugh 'cause it was only meant to be for one night, baby
I guess we can't control
What's just not up to us
Be mine, be mine, yeah
Anytime, anytime

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you know I've been alone for quite a while, haven't I

You, are bringing out a different kind of me (yeah, ooh)
There's no safety net that's underneath

Trapped up on a tightrope now we're here
We're free
Fallin' all in you

[Bridge]
Every time I see you, baby, I get lost
If I'm dreaming, baby, please don't wake me up
Every night I'm with you I fall more in love
Now I'm laying by your side
Everything feels right since you came along
I'm thinking, baby

[Chorus]
You, yeah, are bringing out a different kind of me (ooh)
There's no safety net that's underneath
I'm free
Fallin' all in you (ooh)
Fell for men who weren't how they appear (ooh)
Trapped up on a tightrope now we're here
We're free
Fallin' all in...

If You Know You Know by Pusha T

[Verse 1]
Pullin' up in that new toy
The wrist on that boy rockstar like Pink Floyd
Waving at rude boy, I'm wavin' at you, boy
Ran off on the plug too like Trugoy
Imagine me do-boy, you could never do what I do, boy
Still, duckin' shit that I did, boy
Niggas in Paris 'fore Hit-Boy
These ain't the same type of hits, boy
Shit can get litter than lit, boy
You don't take these type of risks, boy
'Cause this boy been throwin' that D like Rich Boy
You missed, boy; ya numbers don't add up on the blow
That was ten years ago   if you know, you know (Yeah)

[Break]
If you know, you know
If you know, you know

[Verse 2]
This thing of ours, oh, this thing of ours
A fraternity of drug dealers ringin' off
I just happen to be alumni
Too legit, they still lookin' at me with one eye
The company I keep is not corporate enough
Child Rebel Soldier, you ain't orphan enough
A rapper turned trapper can't morph into us
But a trapper turned rapper can morph into Puff
Dance contest for the smokers
I predict snow, Al Roker
(If you know, you know)
I only ever looked up to Sosa
You all get a bird, this nigga Oprah

[Chorus]
Bricklayers in ball shorts
Coachin' from the side of the ball courts
(If you know, you know)
One stop like a Walmart
We got the tennis balls for the wrong sport
(If you know, you know)
If you know 'bout the carport
The trap door's supposed to be awkward
(If you know, you know)
That's the reason we ball for
Circle round twice for the encore
(If you know, you know)

[Verse 3]
You ever been hit with the water weight
Then had to weigh, "Do you war or wait?"
(If you know, you know)
When we all clickin' like Golden State
And you and your team are the motorcade
(If you know, you know)
Been grantin' wishes like a genie
Two bad hoes in two-piece bikinis
I've been hidin' where you can see me
The skybox is right next to RiRi's
Solely responsible for showin' rappers how to stand
On the front lines when trappers started throwin' bands
Where were you when Big Meech brought the tigers in?
'Cause I was busy earnin' stripes like a tiger's skin

[Chorus]
Bricklayers in ball shorts
Coachin' from the side of the ball courts
(If you know, you know)
One stop like a Walmart
We got the tennis balls for the wrong sport
(If you know, you know)
If you know 'bout the carport
The trap door supposed to be awkward
(If you know, you know)
That's the reason we ball for
Circle 'round twice for the encore
(If you know, you know)

Fukk Sleep by A$AP Rocky

[Intro: FKA twigs]
Oh, yeah
Ohh, ahh

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & FKA twigs]
Fuck home, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin'
Can't forget that I'm golden, can't forget where I'm going
Fuck popo, police, enemies, fake homies
Can't forget that I'm a OG, better act like you know it (Oh, yeah)

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky & FKA twigs]
Blunt smoke, smoke weed, codeine, cough
Tell that bitch that I'm awesome, better back the fuck up off me
Coco, Céline, Tiffany, she flossy (oh)
Ain't concerned with who bought these
Can't forget that she bossy
When y'all was buying surfboards trying to ride the wave
I was cooking up another fucking tidal wave (Brrrr)
Had to get entitled motherfuckers out the way
Had to take another title, sorry for the wait (Oop)
Barely ever took a break on, fashion like my time need
More hours in a day, I apologize if I'm late
Tap the vein, whoa, barely look like I'm awake
Darker shades, bluer veins, bluer money in the bankroll

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Fuck home, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin'
Can't forget that I'm golden, can't forget where I'm going
Fuck popo, police, enemies, fake homies
Can't forget that I'm a OG, better act like you know it

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky & FKA twigs]
I remember I was poor and
When I was young and living homeless
Now I rock the Ricky Owens
Eyes lookin' like he rollin'
Got new bags under my eyelids
New bags up in my closets
New bags like I went shoppin'
New bags on new bags
Mind's better at seeing two now (Ah, down)
Needing up on my downtime (Down, down)
Hit the waves with the new sound (Down, down)
House tunes but it's screwed down
That's dope (sauce)
Take a sec to thank the Lord, 'nother one to call my folks
Hit my momma on the phone, she like "son, you the boy" (Ah)
Focus, don't get caught up in the moment (Ah)
Can't forget that I'm golden, don't forget that I'm chosen

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Fuck home, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin'
Can't forget that I'm golden, can't forget where I'm going
Fuck popo, police, enemies, fake homies
Can't forget that I'm a OG, better act like you know it

[Verse 3: FKA Twigs]
They called me a bitch, burned me like saffron
My matter is golden, a child of the odyssey
My touch is righteous, like virus my Midas
I'm golden
He told me when I'm present I'm chosen
So hold me tight, I swear, I'm golden

[Outro: A$AP Rocky and FKA twigs]
Fuck home, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin' (Golden)
Can't forget that I'm golden, can't forget where I'm going (Ahh, yeah)
Fuck popo, police, enemies, fake homies (Ahh)
Can't forget that I'm a OG, better act like you know it

Because I Had You by Shawn Mendes

[Verse 1]
I think it's time that I be honest
Should've told you not to go
Thought I knew just what I wanted
I didn't know myself at all

[Pre-Chorus]
You're with somebody I can't be, yeah
But I can tell that you're happy

[Chorus]
It's time for me to finally meet somebody new
Take her to all the places that I took us to
And she might help me forget
But loving her is something I could never do
Because I had, because I had you

[Verse 2]
Hey, remember when I told you
That you and I will go down in history together, yeah
And does your sister ask about me?
You and I, what we had, is it gone forever?

[Pre-Chorus]
You're with somebody I can't be
But I can tell that you're happy

[Chorus]
It's time for me to finally meet somebody new
Take her to all the places that I took us to
And she might help me forget but loving her is something I could never do
Because I had, because I had you

[Bridge]
There's nothin', oh
There's nothin' left to lose (ooh)
Because I had you, babe
There's nothin'
Nothin' that I could do (ooh)
I wish I had you

[Chorus]
But I think it's time I finally found somebody new
And tell myself that she's the one to get me through
And she might help me forget but loving her is something I just couldn't do
Because I had you

Mutual by Shawn Mendes

[Verse 1]
I want you close to me
I want you close, I want you closer
But when you're here with me
It's hard to tell just what you're after

[Pre-Chorus]
You say, you want all of me today
But tomorrow's not the same
My feelings never change
What do you want from me?
What do you want, uh?

[Chorus]
I need to know
If this is mutual
Before I go
And get way too involved
I want you bad
Can you reciprocate?
No, I don't want to have to leave
But half of you's not enough for me

[Verse 2]
This inconsistency, what does it mean?
You got me questioning, the way you act and take it back
Do I mean anything?
Just tell me honestly

[Pre-Chorus]
You say, you want all of me today
But tomorrow's not the same
My feelings never change
What do you want from me?
What do you want, uh?

[Chorus]
I need to know
If this is mutual
Before I go
And get way too involved
I want you bad
Can you reciprocate?
No, I don't want to have to leave
But half of you's not enough for me

[Bridge]
Are you playin' me, is this a game?
When you show up late, say love at 2 A.M
Then tell me you can't stay, girl, yeah
What do you want from me?
Baby, oh

[Chorus]
I need to know
If this is mutual
Before I go
And get way too involved
I want you bad, baby
Can you reciprocate?
No, I don't want to have to leave
But half of you's not enough for me

Particular Taste by Shawn Mendes

[Verse 1]
She don't listen to a thing, 'less it feels right
Only dances when it's Kanye
She could take you one-on-one if she feels like
You'll be begging her for mercy, mercy

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, she'll take your name and number
Then she'll hit erase and walk away
But ooh, she's so specific when she's at my place
At my place

[Chorus]
She's got particular taste, yeah
She's so obsessed with the chase, yeah
She don't waste time on conversations, no
She just goes right for the face, yeah
She's so particular

Never pickin' up her phone 'less it rings twice
Only answers with a question, "Mhm?"
If I try to play it cool, it never goes right
Got me drownin', drownin', ah

I'm so obsessed with her, yeah
She's so particular
I'm so obsessed with her, yeah
She's so particular

[Bridge]
She's the best at getcha' thinkin' that she don't care
Knows exactly what she wants, uhh
Now she's runnin' all her fingers right through my hair
And it means that

[Chorus]
She's got particular taste (she's got particular taste)
She's so obsessed with the chase, yeah
She don't waste time on conversations, no
She just goes right for the face, yeah (she just goes, she)

[Outro]
She's so particular
I'm so obsessed with her, yeah
She's so particular (she just goes, she)
I'm so obsessed with her, yeah (she's so particular, she just goes)

Why by Shawn Mendes

[Verse 1]
I know a girl, she's like a curse
We want each other, no one will break first
So many nights, trying to find someone new
They don't mean nothing compared to her, and I know

[Pre-Chorus]
When people ask about us, now, we just brush it off
I don't know why we act like it means nothing at all
I wish that I could tell you that you're all that I want, yeah

[Chorus]
I pretend that
I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say "hi" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

[Verse 2]
When I hear you sing, it gets hard to breathe
Can't help but think every song's about me
And every line, every word that I write
You are the muse in the back of my mind, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna ask about it 'cause you might brush it off
I'm afraid you think that it means nothing at all
I don't know why I won't admit that you're all I want

[Chorus]
I pretend that
I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say "hi" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I pretend that
I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say "hi" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?

[Outro]
I know a girl, she's like a curse
We want each other, no one will break first
So many nights, trying to find someone new
They don't mean nothing compared to you

Perfectly Wrong by Shawn Mendes

[Verse 1]
Taste the poison from your lips
Lately, we're as good as gone
Oh, our love is drunk and it's
Singing me my favorite song

[Pre-Chorus]
Me and you
We were made to break
I know the truth
But it's much too late

[Chorus]
You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard to leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
You're perfectly wrong for me
All the stars in the sky could see
Why you're perfectly wrong for me

[Verse 2]
Oh, you know how much it hurts
Every time you say you hate me
But when we're making love, you make it worth it
I can't believe the places that you take me

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no use
We were made to break
I know the truth
And it's much too late

[Chorus]
You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard to leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
Oh, you're perfectly wrong for me
All the stars in the sky could see
Why you're perfectly wrong for me

[Bridge]
Oh, and why can't I quit
When you break my heart open
I need you more than I know
Oh, and I can't resist
When you're up against my skin
I never want to let you go

[Chorus]
You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard for me
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me, mhm
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
Hate that you know that I won't leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me, oh
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard for me
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me, yeah
Oh, you're perfectly wrong for me
Hate that you know that I won't leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me

Queen by Shawn Mendes

[Verse 1]
It's hard to believe
You don't remember me at all
Am I hard to recognize?
You say "nice to meet you" every time
Yeah, and I made you laugh
I still remember what I said
Guess I shouldn't be surprised
You say "nice to meet you" every time

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we got a lot of mutual friends
Don't say my name, don't come up in your conversations, yeah

[Chorus]
Who crowned you queen of
You think you're too cool
Making beautiful look ugly
The way you put yourself above me
You treat me
Like I got nothin' on you
Making beautiful look ugly
You ain't the ruler of no country
Who made you the queen?

[Verse 2]
I shouldn't stress about
The fact you're not impressed
Are you playing hard to get?
Or maybe you're not interested
I don't understand
Why everybody thinks you're sweet
'Cause I see the opposite
No, you're not so innocent

[Pre-Chorus]
I see the way you're lookin' through me right now
To see if there's somebody cooler around, yeah

[Chorus]
Who crowned you queen of
You think you're too cool
Making beautiful look ugly
The way you put yourself above me
You treat me
Like I got nothin' on you
Making beautiful look ugly
You ain't the ruler of no country
Who made you the queen?

[Bridge]
No, no, no, no, no
Who made you the queen?
Who made you the queen?

[Chorus]
Who crowned you queen of
You think you're too cool
Making beautiful look ugly
The way you put yourself above me (yeah, nah, yeah)
You treat me
Like I got nothin' on you
Making beautiful look ugly (making beautiful look ugly)
You ain't the ruler of no country (you ain't the ruler of no country, babe)

[Outro]
Who made you the queen?
Who made you the queen?
Yeah, you think you're too cool, no
Who made you the queen?
Who made you the queen?

What Would Meek Do? by Pusha T

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Niggas talkin' shit, Push how do you respond?

[Verse 1: Pusha-T]
I'm top five and all of them Dylan
I am the hope, the dope dealers won
Price and the quote, the dope dealers want
Feds takin' pictures like it's GQ (GQ)
This Avianne collarbone is see-through
Angel on my shoulder, "What should we do?" (we do)
Devil on the other, "What would Meek do?"
Pop a wheelie, tell the judge to Akinyele
Middle fingers out the Ghost, screamin' "Makaveli" (come with me)
Hail Mary, the scale fairy
Two sides to every coin so we bail ready (bail ready)
How do you respond?
I let the monies and the fools talk
I let the jewels and the hues talk
Watch face came with a fuse box (fuse box)
Chanel's on ya bitch
The coupe is 320, the roof's hit or miss
Murder on the highway, the news is at six
See, I did it my way, the proof's in the bricks
Eghck! Smell it through the Tupperware (Tupperware)
Two can get you four like a double dare (woo!)
I'm the king of the oven-ware (oven-ware)
You can piece the whole puzzle here

[Chorus: Pusha-T]
Niggas talkin' shit, 'Ye how do you respond?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Poop, scoop!
Whoop! Whoopty-whoop!
Am I too complex for ComplexCon?
Everything Ye say cause a new debate
"You see, he been out of touch, he cannot relate
His hallway too long, bitch too bad
Got a surrogate, his kid get two dads"
I be thinkin', "What would 2Pac do?"
You be thinkin' what New Kids on the Block do
If you ain't drivin' while Black, do they stop you?
Will MAGA hats let me slide like a drive-thru?
That phone call from Ricky still hazy
When heaven got an angel named Avery
You gotta watch who you callin' crazy
Yeezy, the newest billion-dollar baby
It won't feel right 'til I feel like Phil Knight
Goin' for six rings like what Phil told Mike
Seven pill nights, who know what that feel like?
No more hidin' the scars, I show 'em like Seal, right?
How do you respond?

Shut the fuck up 'fore I rock your bitch, ya heard? Uh
Shut the fuck up!

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky & Puff Daddy]
My mama named me, my papa gave me cock to take a piss with
To fuck ya bitch with, life is different for me, for instance
The type of niggas spray his kids in some chicks
He wouldn't raise his kids with, that type of twisted sick shit
Come on, man

[Interlude: Woman & Puff Daddy]
What you say, nigga? Time's out
Let's start over with this conversation
You sound super crazy right now
And I got my two kids listenin'? (I'm just playing)
You said what? (I said I'm just-)

Distorted Records by A$AP Rocky

[Intro]
Uh, uh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can feel the bass, from the ceiling to the basement
I don't feel a thing, get the fuck up out my face, bitch
I don't feel a thing, yeah I'm faded, yeah I'm shaded
I don't feel a thing, I can feel the bass, I can feel the bass

[Verse]
First things first, I done heard the worst things
Like if I'm in your top 10, mine's better be the first name
Out your mouth, ain't even worth saying
Little niggas is my offsprings
They deserve a nigga first name, middle name, surname
From another planet, birthplace, Cloud 9, hello earthlings
My newest President an asshole
I guess that's why I'm leaving turd stains
My ex used to chill with bad tings
All they talked about was bird things
Tried to put them on Bad Brains
But bird hoes got the bird brains
Everything I do groundbreak
Big body make the floor break
Big bass make the world shake
Flacko out here causin' earthquakes, uh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Uh, I can feel the bass, uh, I can see the fakes
Word to T.D. Jakes, uh, word to Pastor Ma$e and Kirk Franklin

When You're Ready by Shawn Mendes

[Verse 1]
Maybe I had too many drinks, but that's just what I needed
I hope that you don't think that what I'm saying sounds conceited
When I look across the room and you're staring right back at me
Like somebody told a joke and we're the only ones laughin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't know why I try 'cause ain't nobody like you
Familiar disappointment every single time I do
And every single night my arms are not around you
My mind's still wrapped around you

[Chorus]
Baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
Baby, anytime you're ready
I'm waitin'
Even ten years from now, if you haven't found somebody
I promise I'll be around
Tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'

[Verse 2]
What if my dad is right when he says that you're the one
No, I can't even argue, I won't even fight him on it
Call you when it's late and I know that you're in bed
'Cause I'm three hours back, seems like you're always six ahead

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't know why I try 'cause ain't nobody like you
Familiar disappointment every single time I do
And every single night my arms are not around you
My mind's still wrapped around you

[Chorus]
Baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
Baby, anytime you're ready
I'm waitin'
Even ten years from now, if you haven't found somebody
I promise I'll be around
Tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin', yeah

[Bridge]
And if I have to, I'll wait forever
Say the word and I'll change my plans
Yeah, you know that we fit together
I know your heart like the back of my hand

[Chorus]
So baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
Baby, any time you're ready
I'm waitin', yeah
Even ten years from now, if you haven't found somebody
I promise I'll be around
Tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin', yeah
Baby, tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin'
Baby, any time you're ready
I'm waitin', oh
Even ten years from now, if you haven't found somebody
I promise I'll be around
Tell me when you're ready
I'm waitin', I'm waitin'

Give Yourself A Try by The 1975

[Verse 1]
You learn a couple things when you get to my age
Like friends don't lie and it all tastes the same in the dark
When your vinyl and your coffee collection is a sign of the times
You're getting spiritually enlightened at 29

[Chorus]
So just give yourself a try
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give?

[Verse 2]
I found a grey hair in one of my zoots
Like context in a modern debate, I just took it out
The only apparatus required for happiness is your pain and fucking going outside
And getting STDs at 27 really isn't the vibe
Jane took her own life at 16
She was a kid who had the box tattooed on her arm
And I was 25 and afraid to go outside
A millennial that baby-boomers like

[Chorus]
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give?

[Verse 3]
And what would you say to your younger self?
Growing a beard's quite hard
And whiskey never starts to taste nice
And you'll make a lot of money, and it's funny
'Cause you'll move somewhere sunny and get addicted to drugs
And spend obscene amounts on fucking seeds and beans online

[Chorus]
So just give yourself a try
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give?

Humility (feat. George Benson) by Gorillaz

[Verse 1]
Calling the world from isolation
'Cause right now, that's the ball where we be chained
And if you're coming back to find me
You'd better have good aim

[Pre-Chorus]
Shoot it true, I need you in the picture
That's why I'm calling you

[Chorus]
(Calling you) I'm the lonely twin, the left hand
Reset myself and get back on track
I don't want this isolation
See the state I'm in now?

[Verse 2]
Calling the hunter with the rifle
'Cause right now, that's the ball where we be chained

[Pre-Chorus]
Shoot it true, I want you in the picture
That's why I'm calling you

[Chorus]
(Calling you) I'm the lonely twin, the left hand
Reset myself and get back on track
I don't want this isolation
See the state I'm in now?

[Bridge]
If I pick it up when I know that it's broken
Do I put it back?
Or do I head out onto the lonesome trail
And let you down?

[Chorus]
I'm the lonely twin, the left hand
(If I pick it up when I know that it's broken
Do I put it back?)
I don't want this isolation
(Or do I head out onto the lonesome trail)
See the state I'm in now?
(And let you down?)

[Outro]
If I pick it up when I know that it's broken
Do I put it back?
Or do I head out onto the lonesome trail
And let you go?

I love all your shit talkin', I love all your shit talkin 
You ain't got nothin' better to... do with yourself?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I done proved to myself, back on that rulin  myself
I got new news to tell, act like you knew you done failed
Only true know how I feel and only if you knew how I felt
Sniffed a lil' bootch off the nail
Through with mixed messages, through with the mail
Only a few in the field, little bit off for the real

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
It's so many days I prayed to God
All this pain, I couldn't seem to find a way
On a mission livin', carry on
Got my family, I'm seein' through better days
Never late, pull up a seat and come grab a plate
Check the date, let 'em hate
This the type shit that they couldn t make, watch the fakes
Leave  em buzzin', thought they wasn t, huh?
Tell all your kinfolk and cousins, huh?
This is the package you ordered, huh?
Beautiful madness

[Outro: Kid Cudi]
On this road I find (hmm-mmm)
These scars I left behind (hmm-mmm)
Heaven lift me up (hmm-mmm)
Heaven lift me up (hmm-mmm)
On this road I find (hmm-mmm)
These scars I left behind (hmm-mmm)
Heaven lift me up (hmm-mmm)
Heaven lift me up (hmm-mmm)

Freeee (Ghost Town Pt. 2) by KIDS SEE GHOSTS

[Intro: Marcus Garvey]
May I say something to you to give you a true knowledge of yourself and life?
Man in the full knowledge of himself is a superb and supreme creature of creation
When man becomes possessor of the knowledge of himself, he becomes the master of his environment

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I don't feel pain anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel free (Scoop!)
Nothin' hurts me anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel free

And you know damn well
He lift me up every time that I fell
And set me free, yeah
Ah! You should quit your job to this
Hold up, let 'em politic, ooh
One day they hate you
Next day they love you
I'm still yellin' "fuck you"

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Stop that movement, stop that movement
Y'all can't move me, this my movie
Y'all can't stop me, y'all too sloppy
Carbon copied, carbon
Same thing, in a room
Sittin' by myself, findin' heaven soon
Many things that will trouble you
Look beyond for a feelin' like you never knew
Reachin' out, huntin' for the truth
I'm guessin' I'm just sick of runnin'
All this time searchin' hard for somethin'
I can hear the angels comin'

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Well, it took me long enough to rap on this strong enough
Paid this shit just gon' give up, 'cause Ye just gon' live up
To everything that sucks to you and that's never enough
Thought I'd be clever enough to give up while I'm ahead
I like breakfast in bed, but I love breakfast and head
For anybody who said that I was better off dead
Told 'em, "Don't ever believe nothin' that you ever read"
Got a Bible by my bed, oh yes, I'm very Christian
Constantly repentin', 'cause, yes, I never listen
Don't like bein' questioned and don't like bein' less than
Any a competition in any of my professions
So I gotta guess then, I gotta stay the best man
What else you expect from, uh, Mr. West, man
Painting from Wes Lang, hung in my space like a relative
That you ain't seen in a minute, called on the telephone
And when they see you they say,  Damn you got hella grown
Always thought you'd make it, but damn now you hella known"
Let's address some topics that I can embellish on
How we made enough bread for us to put some relish on
I won't relish on the fact I'm vibin' on the future
Ultralight buildin' in the buildin' by Miuccia
Herzog and de Meuron in an office out in Basel
No not Miami, Switzerland (Switzerland, ahahaha)

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Find my back in the cold, trapped in another soul, they can hear me holler
I'm caught in it again, see 'em all strapped in an' can't move and I'm sinkin' lower
Heaven gonna help me 'cause I feel the world weighin' on me heavy, tryna keep it steady
Ready for the mission, God, shine your love on me, save me, please
If I'm goin' alone, I've been gone for so long, ain't nobody, you can't hear a word
Perched in the night, lookin  out nowhere, where's home? I done hit a nerve
Pain in my eyes, everytime I find, I'm stronger than I ever was
Here we go again, God, shine your love on me, save me, please

Everybody want world peace
'Til your niece get shot in the dome-piece
Then you go and buy your own piece
Hopin' it'll help you find your own peace
Bring light to what they don't see
Auntie cryin' on the concrete
Talkin' to dispatcher then the phone beep
On the other line was the homies
Told her that you ain't comin' home, see
When she heard the news it hurt her bone-deep
Caught with the rifle with the long reach
Just another cycle of the lonely
All growin' up in environment
Where doin' crime the requirement
They send us off to prison for retirement
Hopefully Alice Johnson will inspire men

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson, Kid Cudi & Kanye West]
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah

Cops Shot The Kid by Nas

[Intro: Richard Pryor]
The cops used to come around in my neighborhood
"Alright, you kids, stop having so much fun, move along!"
Oh they'd arrest me, you know, especially at night
They had a curfew, niggas had to be home at 11, negros, 12
And you'd be trying to get home, doing your crew runs
And they'd always catch you out in front of a store or something
'Cause you'd be taking shortcuts, right
Cops, "Ree, put your hands up, black boy!"

[Chorus: Slick Rick]
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot 
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot 
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot 
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot 
The cops shot the kid

[Verse 1: Nas]
I don't wanna hurt nobody
We just came here to party
See a few dames, exchange some names
I'm a top shotta, kid, stay in your lane
The cop shot the kid, same old scene
Pour out a little liquor, champagne for pain
Slap-boxin' in the street
Crack the hydrant in the heat
Cop cars on the creep
Doin' they round-ups, we just watch for the sweep
Yeah, it's hotter than July
It's the summer when niggas die
It's the summer when niggas ride
Together we'll be strong, but forever we divide
So y'all are blowin' my high
Type of shit that's killin' my vibe
White kids are brought in alive
Black kids get hit with like five
Get scared, you panic, you're goin' down
The disadvantages of the brown
How in the hell the parents gon' bury their own kids
Not the other way around?
Reminds me of Emmett Till
Let's remind 'em why Kap kneels

[Chorus: Slick Rick]
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot 
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot 
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot 
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot 
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot 
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot 
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot 
The cops shot the kid
I still hear him scream

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Stay tuned up and down your timeline
This fake news, people is all lyin'
Money is bein' made when a mom cries
Won't be satisfied 'til we all die
Tell me, who do we call to report crime
If 9-1-1 doin' the driveby?
It's certain things I can't abide by
I ain't bein' extreme, this is my side
Talkin' big shit, ready to die
I know every story got two sides
Claimin' he paranoid by the black guy
Cop wanna make it home by nighttime
Just a good kid, he wasn't that guy
Had a little hit, he wasn't that high
Cop gon' claim that it was self-defense
Say he was ridin' dirty so the case rests

[Chorus: Slick Rick & Kanye West]
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot  (workin' nine-to-five)
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot  (tryna stay alive)
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot  (makin' ends meet)
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot  (shot him this week)
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot 
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot 
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot 
The cops shot the kid
I still hear him scream

Valentine by 5 Seconds of Summer

[Verse 1: Calum]
I love the light in your eyes and the dark in your heart
You love our permanent chase and the bite of our bark
We know we're classic together like Egyptian gold
We love us

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
It don't matter, be combative or be sweet cherry pie
It don't matter just as long as I get all you tonight

[Chorus: Luke, Michael & Calum]
I can take you out, oh, oh
We can kill some time, stay home
Throw balloons, teddy bears and the chocolate eclairs away
Got nothing but love for you, fall more in love every day
Valentine, valentine

[Verse 2: Michael]
So deep, your DNA's being messed with my touch

It don t matter be combative or be sweet cherry pie
It don t matter just as long as I get all you tonight

[Chorus: Luke, Michael & Calum]

Throw balloons, teddy bears and the chocolate eclairs away
Got nothing but love for you, fall more in love every day
Valentine, valentine

Full plate, don t wait, have your cake and eat it too
Full plate, don t wait, have your cake and eat it

Not For Radio by Nas

[Intro: Nas & Puff Daddy]
Escobar season begins
Ayo, we ain't posin' for no pictures in 2018
Candid shit only
Scared motherfuckers

[Verse 1: Nas & Puff Daddy]
Black Kemet gods (yeah), black Egyptian gods (let's go)
Summoned from heaven, blessed, dressed in only Goyard
Homie go hard like Stone and Robert in a stolen car
Shoot the ballot box, no voter card, they all are frauds
Senegal's finest, minerals, diamonds
The Earth is cursed but I survive many climates
Calm and thoroughly, they try to Hyman Roth me
John Fitzgerald me, the industry never bought me
(You know God sent me here)
Fear will make you reveal who you really are
Feel me God? Be solid, your foes hold you in ill regard
This ain't knowledge, this is not intense
For honored men, women too
Us who can see the same thing, but have a different view (let's go)
All of a sudden, frontin' niggas knew you from your past
Got all kinds of guys sayin' we go way back
And who y'all comparin' me to is nonsense
Show gratitude in the presence of dominance

[Chorus: 070 Shake & Nas]
I think they scared of us, yeah
I think they scared of us
I think they scared of us, yeah
I think they scared
To Catholics 

[Verse 2: Nas & Puff Daddy]
To Catholics, Moors and Masons (motherfuckers!)
John Hanson was not the first black pres to make it
Abe Lincoln did not free the enslaved
Progress was made 'cause we forced the proclamation
(Fuck your proclamation!)
SWAT was created to stop the Panthers
Glocks were created for murder enhancement
For hunting men, circumstances
Edgar Hoover was black
Willie Lynch is a myth, Colombians created crack
The government made stacks (welcome to America, niggas!)
Reagan had Alzheimer's, that's true
Fox News was started by a black dude, also true (fuck you too!)
Convinced my experiences were meant to be
Helps me navigate as they validate they treachery
Felt established, fake as he smile, handshake questionable
"Am I good?" he ask, thinkin', "But is he testin' you?"
(Is he testin' you?) In my hood, fear does a few things
Make you pussy, make you a snitch
Make irrational moves or even turn you to food

[Chorus: 070 Shake & Puff Daddy]
I think they're scared of us, yeah
I think they're scared of us
I think they're scared of us, yeah
I think they scared
I think they scared of us, yeah
I think they scared of us
See, we don't care about what you think about us
I think they scared of us, yeah
What you say about us
I think they scared
You bitch ass, yeah

[Outro: Puff Daddy]
Ayo, that's why they be killing us and shooting us
That's why they feel uncomfortable around us
'Cause of our greatness
You're lucky God made us compassionate
And forgiving
Pssh, man, they scared of us, Nas
We see that bitch in your eyes

Say Amen (Saturday Night) by Panic! At The Disco

[Intro]
Cold open

[Chopped Vocals]

[Verse 1]
Been trav'lin' in packs that I can't carry anymore
Been waitin' for somebody else to carry me
There's nothin' that's there for me at my door
All the people I know aren't who they used to be
And if I try to change my life one more day
There would be nobody else to save
And I can't change into a person I don't wanna be, so
Oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

[Chorus]
I pray for the wicked on the weekend
Mama, can I get another amen?
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah
Swear to God, I ain't ever gonna repent
Mama, can I get another amen?
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

[Chopped Interlude]

[Verse 2]
And every mornin' when I wake up
I wanna be who I couldn't say I'd ever been
But it's so much more than I ever was
If every night I go to sleep knowin'
That I gave everything that I had to give
Then it's all I could've asked for
I've been standing up beside everything I've ever said, but
Oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

[Chorus]
I pray for the wicked on the weekend
Mama, can I get another amen?
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah
Swear to God, I ain't ever gonna repent
Mama, can I get another amen?
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

[Bridge]
If I had one more day to wish
If I had one more day
To be better than I could have ever been
If I had one more day to wish
If I had one more day
I could be better, but, baby
Oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

[Chorus]
I pray for the wicked on the weekend
Mama, can I get another amen?
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah
Swear to God, I ain't ever gonna repent
Mama, can I get another amen?
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

Roaring 20s by Panic! At The Disco

[Verse 1]
Broadway is black like a sinkhole
Everyone raced to the suburbs
And I'm on the rooftop with curious strangers
This is the oddest of summers
Maybe I'll medicate, maybe inebriate
Strange situations, I get anxious
Maybe I'll smile a bit, maybe the opposite
But pray that they don't call me thankless

[Pre-Chorus]
My Tell-Tale Heart's a hammer in my chest
Cut me a silk tie tourniquet

[Chorus]
This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
My roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I want, I wanna go home

[Verse 2]
Oscars and Emmys and Grammys
Everyone here is a trophy
And I'm sipping bourbon
The future's uncertain
The past on the pavement below me
Maybe I'll elevate, maybe I'm second rate
So unaware of my status
Maybe I'm overjoyed, maybe I'm paranoid
Designer me up in straight jackets

[Pre-Chorus]
My Tell-Tale Heart's a hammer in my chest
Cut me a silk tie tourniquet

[Chorus]
This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
My roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I want, I wanna go home

[Bridge]
Hallucinations only mean that your brain is on fire
If it's Lord of the Flies in my mind tonight
I don't know if I will survive
Lighters up if you're feeling me
Fade to black if you're not mine
'Cause I just need a sign or a signal inside

[Chorus]
This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me a, roll me a blunt
This is my roaring, roaring 20s
I don't even know me
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I wanna go home
Roll me like a blunt 'cause I want, I wanna go home

[Outro]
Oh-woah
Oh-woah
I wanna go home

Legends by Juice WRLD

[Intro]
I usually don't speak on shit like this, but
Ain't nobody else saying shit
Daytrip took it to ten

[Chorus]
I usually have an answer to the question
But this time I'm gon' be quiet (This time)
Ain't nothing like the feeling of uncertainty, the eeriness of silence
This time, it was so unexpected
Last time, it was the drugs he was lacing
All legends fall in the making
Sorry truth, dying young, demon youth

They tell me I'ma be a legend
I don't want that title now
'Cause all the legends seem to die out
What the fuck is this 'bout?

[Interlude]
I'm tryna make it out
I'm tryna change the world
I'm tryna take her out
I'm tryna take your girl
More importantly, I'm tryna change the world
Maybe flex with some diamonds and pearls, yeah

[Chorus]
I usually have an answer to the question
But this time I'm gon' be quiet (this time)

All legends fall in the making
Sorry truth, dying young, demon youth

My mind is foggy, I'm so confused
We keep on losing our legends to
The cruel cold world, what is it coming to?
The end of the world, is it coming soon?

[Bridge]
Yeah, ooh, ooh, oh
That hit's for you

[Chorus]
I usually have an answer to the question
But this time I'm gon' be quiet (this time)

Comin' over in my direction
So thankful for that, it's such a blessin', yeah

Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly

Got the only key, know how to turn it on
The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear
Baby, take it slow so we can last long

Do I put it back?
Or do I head out onto the lonesome trail
And let you down?

None of that shit matter now
Niggas think they run the town
'Til we run 'em out of town
And they gotta relocate
Gotta dip from where they stay
Everything will be okay
Man, just stay up out my way

[Chorus]
Skid around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes
If I touch studio then we got one
I be tryna laugh with the bros 'bout the opps that we know
But they can't take a joke, 'cause it's not one
Think it's 'cause we live by the code, reputation to uphold
Makin' me the one they gotta take the spot from
I be tryna laugh with the bros but they can't take a joke

[Interlude]
Ayo, blast that shit, Maxx
Blast that shit back if you blastin'
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Back and forth to Italy
My comment section killin' me
I swear I get so passionate
Y'all do not know the half of it
I grew up with the Reps Up boys, we crashin' it and splashin' in
And when I say they crashin' it, I do not mean a accident
I'm  I'm still in the studio at 6:45
And my haters either on they way to work or they arrived
And I gotta own the things I rap about just for my pride
You know when it comes to pride, I can't put that shit aside
I've been kicked when I was down
None of that shit matter now
They be throwin' in the towel
I do yellowtail at TAO
They be watchin' what they say
Especially when it's to my face
Everything will be okay
Man, just stay up out my way

[Chorus]
Skid around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes
If I touch studio then we got one
I be tryna laugh with the bros 'bout the opps that we know
But they can't take a joke, 'cause it's not one
Think it's 'cause we live by the code, reputation to uphold
Makin' me the one they gotta take the spot from
I be tryna laugh with the bros but they can't take a joke

65th & Ingleside by Chance the Rapper

[Chorus: Peter Cottontale]
There's a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know
There's a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay
There's a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know
There's a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay

[Verse 1]
I could spare a rib to get my baby back
I just wanna fall asleep where my baby at
So I don't wake up wondering where my baby at
I wonder if we'll make it back
I wonder "Can I pay her back, please"
65th and Ingleside
Way before Jamie got his jingles right
I was sleeping with you every single night
But I was still tryna act single right
65th and Ingleside
I was stacking chips like bingo night
I didn't have to pay for a single light
So I'ma make sure everything go right

[Chorus: Peter Cottontale]
There's a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know
There's a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay

[Verse 2]
Your sister owned the house we lived in
On the East Side that you rented
Little two flat, inexpensive
I didn't have a glove to pitch in
I didn't have a pot to piss in
Not to mention in Dro City
Not a lot of jobs with pensions
All my raps was 'bout suspension
Then one day Donald took me on tour
Young broke Chano ain't broke no more
Thought you wouldn't want me come and darken your doorstep
But I still haven't given you what's yours yet
65th and Ingleside
Moved downtown for a single life
None of my stars ever twinkled bright
'Til God decide to come bring you by

[Chorus: Peter Cottontale]
There's a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know
There's a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay

[Verse 3]
Where's the return on investment? My first A&R
That shit was played unless you would hit play in the car
We hit the Shell station, I tell you stay in the car
Back in the spot, don't put it in park
Leave that bitch running in case I come running
And skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, grab the gold SCAR
There it get late 'fore it's dark
Kensli couldn't play in the park
Now she could play in the stars
High rise, eye to eye with fireworks
So high your ears fire, they might've burst
Every time they buy a verse, I buy a purse
But you can't buy back time, that's just not how it works
Three jobs, you afforded the crib
Fuck child support, you supported the kid
A full rack a month, nothing short of my rib
So you first up, go in order of dibs
My big homie told me, "Nigga growth and development
Go and settle down, don't settle for settlement"
She got you closer to God than you two ever been
She moved over from Evanston, you moved over from Eggleston
First lady you knew, you can't marry her?
Got shit sonny, now you can't share?
New Dad step in, you can t stare?
You knew the power in the woman that could lead you in prayer
On 65th and Ingleside
Feel like you remember every single lie
Truth is I just really need your finger size
So I can make sure that they make the ring so tight

[Chorus: Peter Cottontale]
There's a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know
There's a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay

Love It If We Made It by The 1975

[Verse 1]
We're fucking in a car, shooting heroin
Saying controversial things just for the hell of it
Selling melanin and then suffocate the black men
Start with misdemeanours and we'll make a business out of them
And we can find out the information
Access all the applications
That are hardening positions based on miscommunication
Oh, fuck your feelings
Truth is only hearsay
We're just left to decay
Modernity has failed us

[Chorus]
And I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it

[Verse 2]
And poison me, daddy
I got the Jones right through my bones
Write it on a piece of stone
A beach of drowning three-year olds
Rest in peace Lil Peep
The poetry is in the streets
Jesus save us
Modernity has failed us

[Chorus]
And I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
I'd love it if we made it

Tell me something I didn't know

[Bridge]
Consultation
Degradation
Fossil fueling
Masturbation
Immigration
Liberal kitsch
Kneeling on a pitch

[Verse 3]
"I moved on her like a bitch!"
Excited to be indicted
Unrequited house with seven pools
"Thank you Kanye, very cool!"
The war has been incited
And guess what, you're all invited
And you're famous
Modernity has failed us

[Outro]
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
Tell me something I didn't know
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it
And I'd love it if we made it

COFFEE BEAN by Travis Scott

[Intro]
(This is all)
This is all

[Chorus 1]
Bad-bad news
I'm just bad, bad news
Good thing, the two
Bonnie and Clyde, the money and who?
It's bad news
Bad, bad for you
But I'm back on the coffee bean (Bean)
Anything in between, yeah (This is all, this is all)
Back of the coffee line
Back, back, back in the bathroom line (This is all)

[Verse 1]
How would you feel if I had you? (This is all)
Trust me, you would be mad too (This is all)
Shawty, we can be mad cool
Just hit me if anything past due
Your family told you I'm a bad move (This is all)
Plus, I'm already a black dude
Leavin' the bathroom, my hands is half-rinsed
If only a nigga just had sense
Speaking in past tense (This is all)
It's been a week and a half since
We ain't been speaking and that meant
You feeling free in my absence
I've been going through a lot behind this glass tint, yeah
(This is all, this is all)

[Chorus 2]
Back of the coffee line
Back, back, yeah, back in the bathroom line (This is)
I know they told you I'd be bad for you (This is all)
Don't worry, I'll be back for you
All the money and cars, stripper hoes and the tattoos
Bad news
Back off a coffee bean, reflecting on all you see
(This is all, this is all)

[Verse 2]
Stressing over award shows
She's stressin' over her wardrobe (This is all)
Bought the mansion on foreclose (This is all)
No matter how many tickets your tour sold
You feel this deep in your torso
Feel like someone's readin' your horoscope (Ooh)
Some shit only me and the Lord knows (Ooh)
SOS is for those who hear this in morse code (Ooh)
Too many doors closed, cul-de-sacs and fork roads (Ooh)
Still ended up at the North Pole
This is where remorse goes (This is all)
This shit'll have you in divorce court (Ooh)
Fighting over your seeds
Fighting over your deeds, sliding over your keys (Ooh)
Alimony and fees (Ooh)
As your lawyer proceeds (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
To give out bad news

[Chorus 1]
I'm just bad, bad news
Good thing, the two
Bonnie and Clyde, the money and who?
It's bad news
Bad, bad for you
But I'm back on the coffee bean anything in between
(This is all, this is all)
Back of the coffee line
Back, back, back in the bathroom line, yeah (This is all)

Majesty (with Labrinth & feat. Eminem) by Nicki Minaj

[Chorus: Labrinth]
Whatever you say, Mrs. Majesty (Oh, oh)
Whatever you want, you can have from me (Oh, oh)
I want your love, just lead me on
Won't give it up, hey, hey, hey, hey
 Cause I'm a sucker for ya
Boom shang-a-lang-a-la
Boom shang-a-lang-a-la

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Mmm, uh, yo, I got the money and the power now
The G5'll get me out there in an hour now
The MAC movin  like crack, I'm sellin' powder now
G-Game over, locker room, hit them showers now
I got the trophies and the catalogue
Just did a deal, Mercedes-Benz, check the catalogue
I'm buyin' buildings, we don't buy the blogs (Kyuh)
The Nicki challenge when I fly to Prague, uh

[Refrain: Labrinth]
'Cause I'm a sucker for ya
Boom shang-a-lang-a-la
Boom shang-a-lang-a-la

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Uh, yo, who want it with Nicki now?
I smoke  em like hippies now
They see me, say, "Yippie," now
Homes runnin  like Griffey now
They switchin' like sissies now
You niggas is iffy now
Bitches tune switchin  up
We take 'em to Jiffy now
I'm thicker than peanut butter
He nuttin' like Skippy now
He want me to be his wife
His missus like sippi now, uh

[Chorus: Labrinth]

Boom shang-a-lang-a-la
Boom shang-a-lang-a-la

[Post-Chorus: Eminem]
She invites me to the condo
Uh-oh, wifey's in Chicago (Oh, oh)
My side piece, but she's also
Someone's wife, so time we spend is borrowed
But it's our moment right here, fuck tomorrow
'Cause moments like these are to die for
And she's clear, all nice and easy
As hair when I'm bleaching it blonde
So we got that lightning in a bottle (Oh)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
She's tipsy, I'm sober
So she gets a chip on her shoulder
Sits on the sofa, I go to load a
Slick Rick song or throw some Souls of Mischief on
She goes, "All that old school hip-hop is over
Think that shit's got pneumonia"
I told her, "Bitch, now, just hold up!"
That's why rap needs a doctor
Our genre's lymph nodes are swole up
It's time to check it for strep or some tonsillitis
'Cause like what they swab you with when your throat hurts
That's why Tribe is so vital: we need Q-Tip for the culture
(Speed it up a little bit)
You ain't dealin' with a fuckin' featherweight
I used to medicate until I'd get a fuckin' bellyache
And now I'm finna step on the pedal, don't wanna ever brake
I wanna accelerate to a level that I can elevate
Demented with the pen, I'll make the mothafucker detonate
I wanna make it acapella wait, I gotta set a date
With the devil and celebrate, together we can renovate
And re-develop, Hell awaits, and I'ma get a special place
Now, take a ride with me, hop into my time machine
I'ma take the driver's seat as I thrust into hyperspeed
Like I'm a meteorite, and mothafuck the fucking media
Right in the behind; I'm a human encyclopedia
I must be like pie crust because I was bred to rise like I was yeast
And you're never gonna reach these heights
They're just too high to reach
And I ain't even reached my fuckin' highest
You better pick another game, try hide-and-seek
And you might wanna decide to cheat
'Cause you gotta open your eyes to peek
Am I indeed the last of a dying breed?
Even if you fire-breathe, ain't shit you can say to inspire heat
If you wrapped your entire meat pad up in a dryer sheet
And I'm back to rule the kingdom of fuck it
Better not use me as your topic
Anybody who brings me up, duck it
Let me keep it 100
Two things shouldn't be your themes of discussion
The queen and her husband
Last thing you're gonna wanna be is our subjects, yeah

[Chorus: Labrinth]
Whatever you say, Mrs. Majesty (Oh, oh)
Whatever you want, you can have from me (Oh, oh)
I want your love, just lead me on
Won't give it up, hey, hey, hey, hey
'Cause I'm a sucker for ya
Boom shang-a-lang-a-la
Boom shang-a-lang-a-la

[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, now let me hit you back
Told 'em I'd get you back
I know you sittin' there just thinkin' 'bout who did you that
I am who did you that
You trippin', did you pack?
Can't post on Nicki block unless you sellin' Nicki crack
Here, take a Nicki pack
Check out this Nicki act
Nicki this, Nicki that
All these bitches piggyback
Ha, piggyback, ah, ah, ah back
Ah, ah, ah back, ah, ah

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
Out ah road, they lovin' my style
The man dem want digits fi dial
Inna the dance, we a go skin out I know
And when I come out, y'all suicidal
Yeah, on the real, I'm these bitches' idol
Gotta be dumb to make me your rival
'Cause I'm too powerful ('Cause I'm too powerful)
And you not powerful (Yeah, you not powerful)
So say your prayers 'cause you 'bout to die slow (Die slow)
Die slow (Die slow), die slow (Die slow)
Jealousy is a disease, die slow (Die slow)
Die slow (Die slow), die slow
Tell her that jealousy is a disease, die slow

Chun-Li by Nicki Minaj

[Verse 1]
Ayo, look like I'm goin' for a swim
Dunked on 'em, now I'm swingin' off the rim
Bitch ain't comin' off the bench
While I'm comin' off the court fully drenched
Here go some haterade, get ya thirst quenched
Styled on 'em in this Burberry trench
These birds copy every word, every inch
But gang gang got the hammer and the wrench (Brrr)
I pull up in that quarter milli off the lot
Oh, now she tryna be friends like I forgot
Show off my diamonds like I'm signed by the Roc (By the rock)
Ain't pushin' out his babies 'til he buy the rock

[Chorus]
Ayo, I been on, bitch, you been corn
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
I mean I been Storm, X-Men been formed
He keep on dialin' Nicki like the Prince song
I-I-I been on, bitch, you been corn
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
Ayo, I been north, Lara been Croft
Plates say Chun-Li, drop the Benz off

[Interlude 1]
Oh, I get it, huh, they paintin' me out to be the bad guy
Well it's the last time you gonna see a bad guy do the rap game like me

[Verse 2]
I went and copped the chopsticks, put it in my bun just to pop shit
I'm always in the top shit, box seats, bitch, fuck the gossip
How many of them coulda did it with finesse?
Now everybody like, "She really is the best"
You play checkers, couldn't beat me playin' chess
Now I'm about to turn around and beat my chest
Bitch, it's King Kong, yes, it's King Kong
Bitch, it's King Kong, this is King Kong
Chinese ink on, Siamese links on
Call me 2 Chainz, name go ding dong
Bitch, it's King Kong, yes, I'm King Kong
This is King Kong? Yes, Miss King Kong
In my kingdom wit' my Timbs on
How many championships? What? Six rings on

[Interlude 2]
They need rappers like me
They need rappers like me
So they can get on their fucking keyboards
And make me the bad guy, Chun-Li

[Chorus]
Ayo, I been on, bitch, you been corn
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
I mean I been Storm, X-Men been formed
He keep on dialin' Nicki like the Prince song
I-I-I been on, bitch, you been corn
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
Ayo, I been north, Lara been Croft
Plates say Chun-Li, drop the Benz off

[Outro]
I come alive, I, I'm always sky high
Designer thigh highs, it's my lifestyle
I come alive, I, I'm always sky high
Designer thigh highs, it's my lifestyle
I need a Mai Tai, so fuckin' sci-fi
Give me the password to the fuckin' wifi

Album of the Year - Freestyle by J. Cole

[Verse]
Yeah
My mind state feel like the crime in the summertime
Higher than average
Lot of cabbage
Thank God I never abide by the established
Guidelines that keep niggas inside of fabrics
Commissioned by the state, I skate by the masters
Like "Yoo-hoo" with a new-new ridin' passenger
Shout out Oak Cliff, I'm 'bout to fly to Dallas
Decade from now I might just buy the Mavericks
What up, Mark Cuban?
I am only part human, half-man, half-amazing
Plus, I'm good at math like I'm Asian
Hate to use stereotypes but that's light compared to what a nigga get from Caucasians
No race-baitin' treat the beat like Playstation
Reporting to you live from the International Space Station
I probably vacation on Mars
The flow is out of this world and so is the bars
Blow the facade right off of your squad
Lil' rappers, I love you, but you ain't shit 'til you got offers in Prague
Look that shit up
A book, nigga, pick that shit up
Expand your vocab
I'm giving out toe tags for no cash
All summer long plus three seasons after
Please CC a rapper, tell him meet me
It's absolutely imperative that my heat speak to rappers
The problem with this game is this weak sea of rappers
I'm the answer on the low, I'm a cheat sheet for rappers
I came up 'round AC to DC adapters
Plug talk, what I'm really sayin' is a shame but my niggas move 'caine like HBCU Kappas
Whole town full of CC Sabathia's
You think niggas gettin' fat pitchin' crack?
Not really
This is not the eighties, don't be silly
Now we push pills and sell heroin to Billy
Now Billy momma want the judge to pardon his addiction
How many black addicts that got caught up in the system
With no sob stories on your prime time television, I can smell a blatant contradiction
Man, listen
Don't want to fuck up my vibe
Let's end it on a positive note, come see me live
KOD album of the year, undebatably
My cadence be the greatest we've seen since the late MC whose name was The Notorious 
Dreamville stacked like the Warriors
Winning back to back
Next up to bat is my nigga, Bas
After that, Jiddy-J.I.D
That's that New York City kid plus ATL
Me, I'm from the 'Ville, but I know them towns well
Before I had a deal I was givin' niggas hell
Now I'm givin' niggas deals and they givin' niggas hell

Ganja Burn by Nicki Minaj

[Verse 1]
Ayo, as the world turns, the blunt burns
(Who you gettin' at, Nicki?)
Watch them cunts learn
Fashion icon, Audrey Hepburn
I move keys, but you hoes get one turn
Yeah, you get one turn, and one urn
I straighten all these bitches out with one perm
Who ever gassed 'em ain't none of my concern
But, see, the Lord showed me dreams to confirm
They done went to witch doctors to bury the Barbie
But I double back, kill bitches, bury the body
And that go for anybody, you'll be thoroughly sorry
I could wage war or I come in peace like Gandhi
All my powers back, now I'm scary to zombies
Bring the heat to her, sizzle, I ain't talking Kalonji
I done fasted and prayed, had to cleanse my body
Abstaining from sex, had to zen my body
I ain't givin', so don't ask, I don't lend my body
Gotta be king status to give men my body
(He gotta be king status to get in ya body?)
Fuck yeah, 'cause a Queen is what I embody, uh

[Chorus]
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn, yeah
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn, yeah
Every time I get high, I just think about you
Every time I get high, I just think about you
Every time I get high, I just think about you
Every time I get high, I just think about you
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn, yeah
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn, yeah

[Verse 2]
Yo, you can't wear a Nicki wig and then be Nicki
That's like a fat nigga thinkin' he can be Biggie
One rough ride, now you DMX and Swizzy
One hot video, you Hype? Nah, you just giddy
You made one dope beat, now you Kanye?
You got a nigga named JAY, now you 'Yoncé?
You got about three stacks, now you André?
You put a part in your fade, yeah, you Nas, bae
You gotta have real skill, gotta work for that
If it's really your passion, would you give the world for that?
Unlike a lot of these hoes, whether wack or lit
At least I can say I wrote every rap I spit
Put my blood, sweat, and tears in perfectin' my craft
Still every team's number one pick in the draft
You could bring anybody, weatherman, pick a day
I m Kobe, KD, Kyrie, pick a K

[Chorus]
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn, yeah
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn, yeah
Every time I get high, I just think about you
Every time I get high, I just think about you
Every time I get high, I just think about you
Every time I get high, I just think about you
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn, yeah
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn

[Interlude]
I see ya, I see you
I see ya, I see you

[Outro]
To my surprise, I saw you in my eyes
The nights I cried, repented of the lies
To my, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
To my, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Oh, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na (Ooh)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Ooh, burn, baby (Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)

Shake It Up by Trippie Redd

[Chorus]
Ayy, call 'em by, ayy, rub a thigh, uh
Baby shake that ass, shake that pumpkin pie
Twin sisters side by side, shake it side by side
Twin sisters side by side, shake it side by side

Baby shake that ass, shake that pumpkin pie
Twin sisters side by side, shake it side by side

[Verse]
Oh, baby, what you mean?
Go and shake that ass over Big 14
If you want some cash ho, big ass cheeks
Go and shake your ass ho, like the twerk team (Twerk)
Yeah, she gon' shake it like a red nose (Red nose)
Yeah, to the wall to the window (To the window)
Put that ass in reverse just like Uno (Uno)
Told her I'm a big dog just like Cujo (Cujo)
Sing to that bitch like I'm Bruno
Whereabouts of your bitch, I'm like, "Who knows?"
Ayy, drop that ass, baby, not too low
Ayy, shake that ass, bitch, just like ooh-woah

[Chorus]
Ayy, call 'em by, ayy, rub a thigh, uh
Baby shake that ass, shake that pumpkin pie
Twin sisters side by side, shake it side by side
Twin sisters side by side, shake it side by side
Ayy, call 'em by, ayy, rub a thigh, uh
Baby shake that ass, shake that pumpkin pie
Twin sisters side by side, shake it side by side
Twin sisters side by side, shake it side by side
Twin sisters side by side

Rich Sex (feat. Lil Wayne) by Nicki Minaj

[Intro: Nicki Minaj, Brinx Billions & Lil Wayne]
Full blown, run rich, Brinx
Yo, Mula, yo, yeah
Ayo

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I know what these niggas like, and it ain't my charm
I ain't stupid, this $250 on my arm
I like money more than dick, nigga, that's a fact
You think pussy's everything? Well, let's have a chat
A-a-ass out, pussy fat, point me to a rich nigga
Who gon' Rico, Ace me, pay in full my money, Mitch nigga?
I'ma help him fuck the check up, I'ma run the business
If your girl don't get it poppin', put me on your wishlist
Hitlist, now he sendin' gifts like if it's Christmas
He said, "Baby, everyday we ballin'," I say, "Swish, swish"
Got him callin' nonstop 'cause he don't wanna miss this
I said, "Don't panic, keep the faith, nigga, B.I.G.'s bitch"
(Real rich nigga sex)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
If you know your pussy worth a Benz truck (Rich sex)
Don't let homie fuck unless his bands up (Rich sex)
Go to DR, get that fat transfer (Rich sex)
It ain't such a thing as broke and handsome (Ri-Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne & Nicki Minaj]
Lil mama said she only fuckin' on a rich dick
I cum in her face and tell her, "Now you lookin' rich, bitch"
Her friend in the other room, can I get a witness?
We could have some rich sex, cannot have no rich kids
Facts, all my bitches have no limits
Fucked her in a helicopter, now she screamin', "Sky's the limit"
Fuck her in a drop top, now she screamin', "Sky's the limit"
Sent her back to who she with, now she screamin', "Why I'm with him?"
Damn, lil mama said she only suckin' on a rich dick
Make you put your money where your mouth at, that's some lipstick
Let's fuck on the money 'fore we count that, that's some rich shit
Pussy smell like money when I'm down there, that some Nic shit
(Real rich nigga sex)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
If you know your pussy worth a Benz truck (Rich sex)
Don't let homie fuck unless his bands up (Rich sex)
Go to DR, get that fat transfer (Rich sex)
It ain't such a thing as broke and handsome (Ri-Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)
If you let that broke nigga fuck, we tellin' (Rich sex)

Missing My Idols by Trippie Redd

[Verse 1]
Uh, take a vivid picture, no photos
Implement that shit into your mind, just so you know though
Sucka free living, I'ma say that that's the motto
So for any nigga on that sucka shit, I'm no ho bro
Might just have to drop a bomb, Han Solo
Got me bicken back being bool, Quasimoto
All about my paper gotta get my fucking dough ho
Always on the fucking go-go, you a bitch like Tony Romo
Niggas came around now they extinct like Dodos
Meanwhile I'm in New York fucking up SoHo
Just bagged a new chick, Caroline, nickname Coco
Took her to the telly now lil' baby going loco
She just give me face, ain't no fucking that's a no-no
And she going 30 early, dirty, no soap though
I laugh at the haters, everything they say a joke though
And I'm screaming fuck 12, all these foul ass po-po, yeah, uh

[Chorus]
But nowadays I really miss my fucking idols, so that's the title
I grab a bible, pray for my rivals
Dead on arrival, I swear this shit to me like a cycle
Bodies in piles, blood rivers resemble Niles
They need survival, they need to rehearse a recital
I just sit back and listen to old Wayne songs
And get dome from a bitch while I brainstorm
And spit flames while also making it rain storm

[Verse 2]
You see I can't ignore it
And you niggas don't see it's in your brain to snore
And you sleep on me until you can't no more
And don't fake on me and try to play the boy
I don't know why I feel like nobody loves me
Or why they feel like my intention's something ugly
Or why I feel like everyone needs something from me
Or why I feel like everyone just saying fuck me
Or why I feel like the opposition gon' buss me
If I gave you my heart, would you still love me?
Lately, baby, I feel like nobody trust me
Is it just me?
Haha, yeah, hold up

[Chorus]
But nowadays I really miss my fucking idols, so that's the title
I grab a bible, pray for my rivals
Dead on arrival, I swear this shit to me like a cycle
Bodies in piles, blood rivers resemble Niles
They need survival, they need to rehearse a recital
I just sit back and listen to old Wayne songs
And get dome from a bitch while I brainstorm
And spit flames while also making it rain storm

better off by Ariana Grande

[Verse 1]
You keep me in your orbit
Well, I know I'm a hard one to please
Give it too much importance
My love will have you fall to your knees
I tell 'em this too often
Know better than to bark up my tree
Just for me to fall and leave
Nah, I'd rather just watch you smoke and drink, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Steering clear of any headaches to start
And if we're being honest
I'd rather your body than half of your heart
Or jealous-ridden comments
That come when you let in them feelings that I don't want
I never let 'em know too much
Hate gettin' too emotional, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm better off without him
I'm better off being a wild one
On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand
So that I'm better off not being around ya

[Verse 2]
Go on and face it, I'll never be ready for you, ready for you
I swear my love is a curse, make you head over shoes, head over shoes
Let's put them topics to bed and go fuck on the roof, just to say that we did it
You keep insisting I listen to your proposition
I dismiss 'em all, no offense, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Steering clear of any headaches to start
And if we're being honest
I'd rather your body than half of your heart
Or jealous-ridden comments
That come when you let in them feelings that I don't want
I never let 'em know too much
Hate gettin' too emotional, yeah

I'm better off without him
I'm better off being a wild one
On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand
So that I'm better off not being around ya

I'm better off without him
I'm better off being a wild one
On the road a lot, had to keep it a thousand

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams & Ariana Grande]
There is somethin' between us, I can see it right now
Your magnetic demeanor, that s something can't be found
I thought that I was dreamin'  til my love came around
Now I just come on over, show you how we get down
Shawty, you can get blazed

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
I can't believe that you are here, I can't believe it's happening
What are the odds that you'd appear?
The universe so vast to me
Seven billion is on the Earth
Could've been anywhere, but you're here with me
Should I play Lotto? What's it worth?
I must be on, so clear to me

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go

Never let you, never let you go
Never let you

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams & Ariana Grande]
There is somethin  between us, I can see it right now

Now I just come on over, show you how we get down
Shawty, you can get blazed

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Look at you, love, you are the same
You have a light you cannot hide
Yes, you may have a different face
But your soul is the same inside
I don't care who is listening
'Cause they be making fun of this on TV
They wouldn t laugh if they were inside my past life
With you and they were me

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go, oh
Never let you, never let you go, yeah
Never let you

Don't think that it cannot happen, 'cause it can
Shawty, you can get blazed
Sleep if you want, and wake up in love again
Shawty, you can get blazed

They say my system is overloaded
(Girl, what s wrong with you? Come back down)
I'm too much in my head, did you notice?
(Girl, what s wrong with you? Come back down)
My body's here on Earth, but I'm floating
(Girl, what s wrong with you? Come back down)
Disconnected, so sometimes, I feel frozen and alone

[Chorus]
This is for everybody
Babe, you gotta take care of your body, yuh yuh
Ain't no time to deny it, that is why we talking about it
Yeah, we talking about it
To deal with it, don't try to get by it
Ain't no time to deny it
So we had to sit down and just write it

[Verse 2]
Want you to get better (Woo!)
My life is so controlled by the what-ifs
(Girl, what s wrong with you? Come back down)
Is there anybody else whose mind does this, mmm?
(Girl, what s wrong with you? Come back down)
Down, down, down, down
Is there such a ladder to get above this?
(Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down)
(Girl, what s wrong with you? Come back down)
Maybe I should ground myself where the mud is
Before I'm gone

[Chorus]
This is for everybody
Babe, you gotta take care of your body, yuh yuh
Ain't no time to deny it, that is why we talking about it
Yeah, we talking about it
To deal with it, don't try to get by it
Ain't no time to deny it
So we had to sit down and just write it

You wet my eyes
But I don't mind it
I tell you lies
But it's only sometimes
You pick a fight
And I'll define it

[Chorus]
I swear that I (Swear that I)
I only called her one time
Maybe it was two times?
I don't think it was three times
It can't be more than four times
I think we need to rewind
You text that boy sometimes
Must be more than three times
I didn't mean to two-time you

[Verse]
She said that I should have liked it
I told her "I only use it sometimes"
Except when I need reminding
I'm petrified

I don't think it was three times
I didn't mean to two-time, two-time you

[Chorus 2]
All I want you to do for me, is give it to me when you get home
(Re, re, re ,re) Yeah baby
(Re, re, re ,re) Whip it to me
(Respect, just a little bit) When you get home, now
(Just a little bit)

[Verse 5]
R-E-S-P-E-C-T, find out what it means to me
R-E-S-P-E-C-T, take care, TCB, oh

[Outro]
(Sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me)
A little respect
(sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me, sock it to me)
Whoa, babe
(Just a little bit) A little respect
(Just a little bit) I get tired
(Just a little bit) Keep on tryin'
(Just a little bit) You're runnin' out of fools
(Just a little bit) And I ain't lyin'
(Just a little bit)
(Re, re, re, re) Start when you come home
(Re, re, re, respect) Or you might walk in
(Just a little bit) And find out I'm gone
(Just a little bit) I gotta have
(Just a little bit) A little respect
(Just a little bit)

The Return by Logic

[Intro]
Satisfy
Satisfy
Yeah yeah, yeah
Satisfy this hung-you
Sinatra
Big Pepe
Satisfy
Oh, you got the studio shoutout
Satisfy
You feelin' good about yourself right now, huh?
Satisfy this hung-you (6ix)

[Verse 1]
Hold up let me get up in it now
Bitch, I'm here to win it now
L-O-G-I-C, I'm feeling free, I'm finna bring it now
If you know the words, take a step back and sing it now
Never thought I'd have to, but I keep the windows tinted now
Like, la-di-da-di, who got the keys to my Audi?
Last time I said, it went viral, I don't fuck with nobody
And I don't fuck with you, you, them, her and him too
'Cause don't none of y'all know a fucking thing 'bout what I been through
And all that superficial shit you love I'm just not into
And when it comes to gettin' deep in this rap shit I've been to
Like the pussy, don't push me
I ain't no killer, but you know the rest
You think I caught the holy spirit how I'm feelin' blessed
Ain't no contest at all this wack shit, it just ain't no test
Step and get laid to rest, boy, step and get laid to rest
It ain't no "S" on my chest but I'm still gunnin'
While half of these motherfuckers still runnin'
I've earned everything I've attained and they steal from him
Like goddamn, I'm the motherfuckin' man
Used to call you a hater, you a motherfuckin' stan
Ain't nobody built himself a brand like me
I ain't signed a shoe deal 'cause I'm waitin' for Nike
To recognize all these youngins wanna be just like me
Cut the check for twenty million right now and we might see
Everybody rockin' my kicks, preachin' positivity
I get up, I get up

[Chorus]
I get up, when I'm down, had enough, almost drowned
When shit rough I get tough and when I'm beaten to the ground
I get up, I get up
I get up, uh, uh, I get up, uh, uh
I get up, when I'm down, had enough, almost drowned
When shit rough I get tough and when I'm beaten to the ground
I get up, I get up
I get up, uh, uh, I get up, uh, uh
I get up

[Verse 2]
Never address me as "Robert" 'less it's 'bout that Dinero
Far from a hero, I ain't never saved my hoes
I'm not defined by these clothes, and zeros
It don't matter if you got six dollars or six figures on the creep
'Cause in the end we all six feet deep
Meanwhile, I'll be immortalized on this 6ix beat
Flashbacks of havin' visions way back in G'Burg
Every single one of my homies and me work
Cuttin' had to get up out it, make a hit, forget about it
Youngin' wit' a dream but nobody gave a shit about it
Ten years later, pick up a pen, write a hit about it
And back then I thought I'd be defined by how good I rhyme
Not like these rappers with shit flows, but look good online
Not made to feel bad for speakin' bout this shit on my mind
Or called a faggot, a nigger, a cracker who wish he was blacker
I wish I could face my homophobic, racist attacker
And smack the shit outta they ass as peaceful as possible
It's highly improbable, it's stoppable
But still, way too many people feel how I feel
That's on the real, on the real, on the motherfuckin' real

[Chorus]
I get up, when I'm down, had enough, almost drowned
When shit rough I get tough and when I'm beaten to the ground
I get up, I get up
I get up, uh, uh, I get up, uh, uh
I get up, when I'm down, had enough, almost drowned
When shit rough I get tough and when I'm beaten to the ground
I get up, I get up
I get up, uh, uh, I get up, uh, uh

[Verse 3]
Ayo motherfucker, Trump, said that shit on my last album but you wasn't tappin' in
Fuck a mumble let's make America rap again
Industry don't give a fuck about rap or what's happenin'
Fuck a hypebeast, bitch, now who seein' me?
Nobody reports the music, this shit, this rap TMZ
Nowadays everyone divided, so I collided with headlines
Preach that, go 'head boy now preach that
Wash my hands of this negativity, word to Three Stacks
So fresh, so clean, who the illest on the scene?
Wu-Tang, get the cream, Sinatra gon' reign supreme
Open your mental, get out your feelin's like dental
This shit is consequential, lightin' a fire to the game
Can you rappers feel the flame? Nah, this shit won't be the same
Fuck a rap beef, I promise I want all of y'all to prosper
But deep down you know it's only gon' be one Mufasa
I'm the king, fuck the bling, but just might make you kiss the ring
All these rappers I came up on, I surpassed, I know it sting now
Don't try to twist my words and turn that into some shit
I love all you motherfuckers, just want to hear you spit
Dropped my last shit, the whole wide world applauded it
Game still ain't give me my credits, so I'ma audit it
I'm heartless like Kanye in '08
Yeah, that's word to NO I.D, now they all know who I be
I'm callin' out Jay-Z to jump up on the track with me and smack the whole industry
Show 'em what that real rap do
The ball's in your court, Hov, I hope to hear from Guru, woo!

Right Now by Nick Jonas

[Intro: Nick Jonas]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
You are my water, my sun, my moon and stars
Your heart is all I need
It starts when you come
I want to be where you are, where you are (na, na)

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Every time you go away, I'm always tryna fight
How bad I want you (bad I want you), bad I want you (ooh)
I could try to fill the space with someone else tonight
But I don't want to (I don't want to), I don't want to

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
You lead, I follow, no sleep

You in my bed (I need you in my)

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Every time you go away, I'm always tryna fight

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]

[Outro: Nick Jonas]
Oh, you'll never be alone, ooh, yeah
I'll be there, I'll never let you go

'Till I Collapse by Eminem

[Intro: Eminem]
'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
(Yo left, yo left, yo left, right, left)
And when you feel weak (Yo left)
You feel like you wanna just give up (Yo left, yo left)
But you gotta search within you (Right, left)
Try to find that inner strength (Yo left, yo left)
And just pull that shit out of you (Yo left)
And get that motivation to not give up (Right, left, yo left)
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall
(Yo left, yo left, right, left)
Flat on your face and collapse

[Verse 1: Eminem]
'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
 Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fo' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney   Nate, hit me!

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
 Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
 Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest, so

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(Until my legs) 'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Give out from underneath me) I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

[Outro: Eminem & Nate Dogg]
Until the roof (Until the roof)
The roof comes off (The roof comes off)
Until my legs (Until my legs)
Give out from (Underneath me)
I, I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me

My Blood by Twenty One Pilots

[Verse 1]
When everyone you thought you knew
Deserts your fight, I'll go with you
You're facin' down a dark hall
I'll grab my light

[Refrain]
And go with you, I'll go with you
I'll go with you, I'll go with you
I'll go with you, I'll go with you
I'll go with you, I'll go with you

[Verse 3]
If there comes a day
People posted up at the end of your driveway
They're callin' for your head and they're callin' for your name
I'll bomb down on 'em, I'm comin' through
Did they know I was grown with you?
If they're here to smoke, know I'll go with you
Just keep it outside, keep it outside, yeah

[Chorus]
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run

River (feat. Ed Sheeran) by Eminem

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Suzanne"
After the first night, but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was "come sunlight, scram," now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)
River (ooh), river run
Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
River (ooh), we'll let the river run

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Always the bridesmaid, never "The bride, hey!"
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

Lucky Strike by Troye Sivan

Oh, I wanna know just how to love you
The jewel of California
Oh, I wanna skip stones on your skin, boy
And drown me in your water

He knows how to love me better

He knows how to love me better

Short days, long nights, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you

Get lost the more I find ya
Oh, don't wanna miss a second of this, boy
Hold tight and love me longer

Breathe me in, exhale slow
Take me to anywhere you wanna go
Breathe me in, exhale slow
Take me to anywhere you wanna go

[Chorus]
'Cause you're safe like spring time
Short days, long nights, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you
(Tell me all the ways to love you)
'Cause you taste like Lucky Strikes
You drag, I light, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you, yeah
(Tell me all the ways to love you)
Tell me all the ways to love you, oh
(Tell me all the ways to love you)

Ladders by Mac Miller

[Chorus]
Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day
Can't stop, yeah, you won't stop
I know just how that feel
When you're on top, 'til the ball drop
You've never seen it be so real
It feels so good right now
But it all come fallin' down
When the night, meets the light
Turn to day

[Verse 1]
Feel it a little, feel it a lot
I'm swimmin' a bit, but deeper in thought
Keepin' my head on top of my shoulders
Into some shit, I'm out of the box
This the level I'm on
Needin' it all right now when forever is gone
Baby, the weather is strong
Whether it's hot or cold
I'm comin', knockin' on your door
Well, I'ma, I'ma maintain, I'm stayin' so high
Put the ladder all the way up 'til we touchin' the sky
And you know you're dead wrong, you're in love with a lie
All I, all I, all I wanna do is free your mind
We don't see no lines, we don't color inside
It's a very small world, we don't fuck with the size
Yeah, see the bigger picture when it's beneficial
Lovin' how I catch you
Blow the whistle when you run out of time
Yeah, wakin' up I open up my eyes
Do you mind if I blow your mind?
A little closer, baby, don't be shy
Why you worried that it's gon' be fine?
I guess it's that kinda day
It's really all I'm tryna say
We don't have a lot of time to waste
Somehow we gotta find a way

[Chorus]
Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all comes fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day

[Refrain]
I wouldn't wait forever
Just shoot your shot
We don't need no more, no extras
We all we got

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
All the- lights flickerin', hittin' the right switches
I'm livin' this life different and missin' the flight bullshittin'
I had a plan to change, you can't stand the rain
Little delay, but I came and you're cool with it
I don't trip, flip or lose my grip
And I don't know it all, but I do know this
Before you know me, better know self
I've been in this shit so long that it don't smell
I turn the hotel to a castle
Livin' like a king for a grand
I don't do nothin', that's a hassle
Besides, even that castle's made of sand
Just might slip into the sea
Fuck it all, if it all ain't me
Maybe we inside the maze
Somehow, we gotta find a way, okay

[Chorus]
Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all comes fallin' down
When the night, meet the light
Turn to day

[Refrain]
I wouldn't wait forever
Just shoot your shot
We don't need no more, no extras
We all we got

I ain't the same (Same)
Everything is different, I can't complain
You don't know what you missin', shame on you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, shame on you
Everything is strange, that's just a game
Everybody trippin', throwin  it away
We was getting lifted, now we getting paid
Shame on you (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
I paid the cost to see apostrophes
That means it's mine (Yeah,) keep to myself, takin' my time (Uh-huh)
Always into some bullshit, and out of line
Drivin' with my eyes closed, missin' all the signs
Turn the ignition, I'm driven and sittin' pretty (Pretty)
Listenin' to Whitney and whippin' it through the city, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Man on a mission, figure it out
Puttin' way too much on my shoulders, please hold me down (Down, down)
I keep my head above the water (Water)
My eyes gettin' bigger, so the world is gettin' smaller (Smaller)
I be gettin' richer but that only made me crazy
Mama told me I was different even when I was a baby
That Mercedes through the PA when I pull up (Pull up), soundin' like a concert
Or a, or a monster truck, I'm trippin' but I'm fallin' up
Always said I want it all, but it's not enough
O-kay (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I'm always sayin' I won't change but
I ain't the same (Same)
Everything is different, I can't complain
You don't know what you missin', shame on you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, shame on you
And everything is strange, that's just a game
Everybody trippin', throwin  it away
We was getting lifted, now we getting paid
Shame on you (Yeah)

[Bridge]
We only just begun
No, we don't wanna hurt your feelings
'Cause it s only just begun
No, we don't wanna
Hurt (Hurt) feelings (Feelings)

[Verse 2]
Down go the system, long live the king (King)
Turn the power off and get your water from the spring (Spring)
I'm bringing everyone with me when shit get iffy (Yeah)
I give a hundred and fifty percent
This is the shit that I'm dealing with, but I wish I forget
Used to be feelin' depressed, now that I'm living I'm a little obsessed (Yes)
High in Jacuzzis I be hitting the jets
I'm showing her some love she been givin' me sex (Blessed)
Respect to Adonai
Don't fuck around and be a victim of your pride
Why you lyin'? (Why you lyin'?) Tell the truth and step aside
I don't got the time to let it slide (Yep)
I'm too grounded, push whips that move mountains
New cribs, blue fountains, these are my surroundings
I've been going through it, you just go around it
But it's really not that different when you think about it

[Chorus]
I'm always sayin' I won't change but
I ain't the same (Same)
Everything is different, I can't complain
You don't know what you missin', shame on you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, shame on you
And everything is strange, that's just a game
Everybody trippin', throwin  it away
We was getting lifted, now we getting paid
Shame on you (Yeah)

Come Back to Earth by Mac Miller

[Chorus]
My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send
And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head

[Verse]
In my own way, this feel like living
Some alternate reality
And I was drowning, but now I'm swimming
Through stressful waters to relief
Yeah, oh, the things I'd do
To spend a little time in Hell
And what I won't tell you
I'll prolly never even tell myself

[Bridge]
And don't you know that sunshine don't feel right
When you inside all day
I wish it was nice out, but it look like rain
Grey skies, I'm drifting, not living forever
They told me it only gets better

[Chorus]
My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send
And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head

What's the Use? by Mac Miller

[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
You can love it, you can leave it
They say you're nothing without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it?
There's somethin' about it
That just freaks me out
I just want another minute with it, fuck a little
What's the use?
Never superficial, you gon' know it when it hit you
Get a little sentimental when I'm off the juice

[Verse 1]
Yeah, okay we're colder than the breeze
But the breeze ain't flowin' like me, motherfucker hol' up
You don't need to hol' up, yeah
And I can show you how I seem
What it is, what it truly might be, nothin' that you know of
You don't need to hol' up
I'm so a-bove and beyond
You take drugs to make it up way up where we on
Space shuttle, Elon
Time, we don't waste much, fuck when we wake up
Then I have her sing just like Céline Dion
Catch me if you can but, you'll never catch me, damn
Whole lotta "yes I am"
All the way in wit' no exit plan
Already left and the jet don't land
Yeah, the time is tickin', come take a ride, get inside
This is highly different, I'm talkin' fly, got a pilot wit' 'im, uh
Can I mind my business?
Why you trippin'? Give you somethin' that your eyes can witness
Ooh, you're too close
I don't understand why you doin' the most

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Snoop Dogg]
You can love it, you can leave it
They say you're nothin' without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it?
There's something about it
That just freaks me out
I just (I just) want (Want a) another ('Nother) minute (Minute) wit' it
Fuck a little, what's the use?
What's the use? Use?
Never (Never) super- (Super) -ficial (Ficial)
You gon' (You gon')  know it (Know it) when it (When it) hit you (Hit you)
Get a (Get a) little (Little) senti- (Senti) -mental when I'm off the juice (Turn it up)

[Verse 2]
Well I'ma give you what you came for, yeah
Shit, I've worked too hard to have a clue who you are
Set the bar so far above par, we can parlay all day
Crib long range with the yard
I know I should probably pray more but you gotta love me
'Cause I save the day spendin' money
When I had nothin', shit it wasn't so funny
Made a promise to the homies nobody go hungry
Look how far we came, still they throwin' dirt on my name
But it never worried my brain
Heads turnin' like a hurricane swervin'
Tell the sun, "Get up outta my shade"
If they don't get the picture, cut 'em out of that frame, shit
I'm up 30 thou' miles plus change
It's been a while but I'm down 'till I'm out and it is what it is 'til it ain't, yeah

[Bridge: Thundercat]
Ooh oooh
Ooh, I just wanna fly

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Snoop Dogg]
You can love it, you can leave it
They say you're nothin' without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it?
There's something about it
That just freaks me out
I just (I just) want (Want a) another ('Nother) minute (Minute) wit' it
Fuck a little, what's the use?
What's the use? Use?
Never (Never) super- (Super) -ficial (Ficial)
You gon' (You gon')  know it (Know it) when it (When it) hit you (Hit you)
Get a (Get a) little (Little) senti- (Senti) -mental when I'm off the juice (Juice)

Donald Trump by Mac Miller

[Intro]
Hey
Ayo, Sap! What's good, bruh?
This man is kinda high over here Laughs

[Verse 1]
Ayo, the flyest ma'fucker in the room, yeah, you know it's me
Bitches hatin' on him  cause he started out here locally
Hopefully I'll be at the top soon
For now I'm at my house on the couch watchin' cartoons
You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget when you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothin' when you stop and just say fuck it
 Cause you walkin' out in public and you hear them talkin' rubbish
I just wanna ride, ride through the city in a Cutlass
Find a big butt bitch somewhere, get my nuts kissed
That's the way it goes when you party just like I do
Bitches on my dick that used to brush me off in high school

[Refrain]
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit? (Hey)

[Chorus]
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
And they in awe, we gonna win, you can take the lose or draw
What I'm in got these hoes who used to play me in they bras
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Take over the world, watch these haters get mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
Hop into the car and then we take 'em to the pad, it's a wrap

[Verse 2]
Uh, uh, uh
And ma'fuckers think they know me, but they never met the kid
Style come with excellence and money make benevolence
Irrelevant for the fuckers who never been intelligent
I kill my Henny, break the bottle for the hell of it
Tell a bitch that she better bring a friend
And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
Yeah, the party never end, this life is what I recommend
And if you got a ho picked for me then she better be a 10
I ain't picky, but these girls be actin' tricky
When the situation's sticky and the liquor got 'em silly

[Refrain]
But I take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?

[Chorus]
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
And they in awe, we gonna win, you can take the lose or draw
What I'm in got these hoes who used to play me in they bras
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Take over the world, watch these haters get mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
Hop into the car and then we take 'em to the pad, it's a wrap

Love Someone by Lukas Graham

[Verse 1]
There are days
I wake up and I pinch myself
You're with me, not someone else
And I'm scared, yeah, I'm still scared
That it's all a dream

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you still look perfect as days go by
Even the worst ones, you make me smile
I'd stop the world if it gave us time

[Chorus]
'Cause when you love someone
You open up your heart
When you love someone
You make room
If you love someone
And you're not afraid to lose 'em
You probably never loved someone like I do
You probably never loved someone like I do

[Verse 2]
When you say
You love the way I make you feel
Everything becomes so real
Don't be scared, no, don't be scared
'Cause you're all I need

[Pre-Chorus]
And you still look perfect as days go by
Even the worst ones, you make me smile
I'd stop the world if it gave us time

[Chorus]
'Cause when you love someone
You open up your heart
When you love someone
You make room
If you love someone
And you're not afraid to lose 'em
You probably never loved someone like I do
You probably never loved someone like I do

[Bridge]
All my life
I thought it'd be hard to find
The one, 'til I found you
And I find it bittersweet
'Cause you gave me something to lose

[Chorus]
But when you love someone
You open up your heart
When you love someone
You make room
If you love someone
And you're not afraid to lose 'em
You probably never loved someone like I do
You probably never loved someone like I do
You probably never loved someone like I do

The Flute Song by Russ

[Intro]
Legend
People keep talkin'
I don't believe (yeah)

[Chorus]
I do whatever I want, whenever I want, I love it
People keep talkin', I just keep winning
I'm just like "Fuck it"
They talkin' reckless, I don't believe 'em, I think they're bluffin'
They just want clout, I'm just so poppin'
I'm just like "Fuck it"

[Verse 1]
Everybody tryna get a rise out of me (yeah)
Ex girls tryna get a "Hi" out of me (yeah)
I don't talk back 'less you're worthy (no)
Hangin' plaques up like jerseys (sauce)
25 actualized, I'm me
My family relies on me
Treat 5 stars like my home though
Walk around in slippers and robes though
They ain't upholding the code, the industry full of some hoes
They lettin' like anything go
People are shady as fuck
I keep to myself, but I feel the energy though
None of these people are friends to me though
I don't put anything past them
I don't see none of y'all next to me though
I think they mad that I passed them

[Chorus]
I do whatever I want, whenever I want
I love it (woo, woo)
People keep talkin', I just keep winning

I do whatever I want, whenever I want
I love it (woo, woo)
People keep talkin', I just keep winning
I'm just like "Fuck it"
They talkin' reckless, I don't believe 'em, I think they bluffin' (they just be talkin')
They just want clout, I'm just so poppin'
I'm just like "Fuck it" (yeah)

[Verse 2]
I been goin' hard on my Kobe number 8 shit
Course they're gonna hate but I signed up for greatness
That comes with the territory, ain't no way around it, I know that
I been way up in the Hills reflectin', I cannot go back
Beverly Hills, skyline view
I move smart, got a high IQ
Right next to me where you find my crew
All of them fight, bitch, I fight too
Highlight moves every time I play
I get what I want every time I pray
I be doin' good but they don't wanna talk about it
If you really got a grip with my life I say 

[Chorus]
I do whatever I want, whenever I want
I love it (woo, woo)
People keep talkin', I just keep winning
I'm just like "Fuck it"
They talkin' reckless, I don't believe 'em, I think they bluffin' (they just be talkin')
They just want clout, I'm just so poppin'
I'm just like "Fuck it" (yeah, yeah)
I do whatever I want, whenever I want

I've been broken-hearted, now it's fuck that bitch
Getting high to deal with my problems
Fucking bitches, getting drunk as shit

All the lights and call my life
Doctor, doctor, will you help me?
Get me healthy
Keep it low, this where hell be
Ain't shit you can tell me now
Fuck this rap shit, bitch, I'm sellin' out
Ooh shit, with my new bitch you jealous now
Smokin' weed at the crib watching Belly now
All the pain that they causin'

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I been having trouble sleeping
Battling these demons
Wondering what's the thing that keeps me breathing
Is it money, fame or neither?
I been thinking about the places that I frequent
All the people that I see
I m just out here livin' decent
What do it mean to be a G?
And all the time we fall behind
Bitches in the concubine
I call her mine, crazy
She ain't' God as I
I make water wine
Pause in time
It's common, they often hate me
Never will I walk in line
I cross the T's and dot the I's
Wondering, well, wonderin' how I got this high
Fell asleep and forgot to die, God damn
I'm poppin' them downers
And drinkin' them powders, faded
Get it over the counter
I'm stuck on the browser
Like, how did I make it?
These bitches don't know me
This shit is so lonely until she get naked
Don't even know what today is

[Hook: Miguel & Mac Miller]
But I'll be good by the weekend
I'll be good by the weekend
Everything good by the weekend
Everything will be good by the weekend

[Outro: Miguel]
Mondays I think of you, but I ain t tripping on it
Tuesdays I m in, gotta get my hands up on ya
Wednesdays I'm lit with you, you know you're staying over
Thursdays I m sick of you, I got to get rid of you
Cause Fridays are always
The start of the time of my life, alright
When I get faded you hate it
But, baby, it s gon be alright, ha, alright

Pretty Little Fears (feat. J. Cole) by 6LACK

[Verse 1: 6LACK]
Do better, who better?
You better? Been around, like hella, propellers
Wanna know who you with, don't tell 'em
Come on fellas, that ain't none of your biz'
Got on your body suit, you know I'm on your ass today
Would you let me hit it thrice if I asked today?
She know my stick nothing but magic babe
I be swinging it back and forth, 'til you in your casket, bae, mm

[Pre-Chorus: 6LACK]
Girl, you want my best side, mm
Bet she from the westside, mm, mm

[Chorus: 6LACK]
Now I just wanna know
Don't you sugarcoat
I'll say it all if you want
Now could you tell me like it is?
Pretty little fears
Music to my ears

[Verse 2: 6LACK]
Okay, say it loud, say it proud, you want it more
We open door, hit the couch, then the floor
I cut it up, like a scissor, love galore
She never bored, there's so much shit we can do
You free to say whatever, baby, if you askin' me
No limit when I'm in it, got a Master P
I'm hoping I don't have a fast release
Got me focused like I'm out here tryna get my Masters see, mm
Throwin' up the peace sign, mm
Girl, I'm from the Eastside, mmm, mmm

[Pre-Chorus: 6LACK]
Girl, you on my best side, mm
Say she from the west side, mm, mm

[Chorus: 6LACK]
Now I just wanna know

Don't you sugarcoat
I'll say it all if you want
Now could you tell me like it is?
Pretty little fears
Music to my ears

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
I'm lovin' your light, vulnerable
Lettin' your guard down, it's honorable
'Specially when the past ain't been that
Friendly to you but there s magic in that
You the flower that I gotta protect
To keep alive in the winter time, ayy, don't you die yet
You been way more than a friend of mine, we more like fam
I raise you, you raise me, let's turn this whole life 'round
You can confide in me
I could take the weight up off your shoulder blades
And try to store the pain inside of me
Like why the world do you like that?
Like they don't know you God-sent, but me, I view you like that
I'm sneakin' glances thankin  God that he drew you like that
Beautiful black child, come and shed your black cloud
For your vibe and your smile, I don't mind a lil' rain
I'm your dog, ears perk up at the sound of your name
Count on your main, wildfire, can't handle your flame
Download your shame, wild high, come drown in your fragrance
You that red pill that a nigga found in the Matrix
Before I had you this shit was fantasy
You plant a seed to grow some roots, a branch and leaves
Becomes a tree of life until our nights are filled
With peace from stress and strife
And that's the blessing that I get from wifing you
'Cause you entrusted me with the key to your heart
Beating you smart
'Cause even though I need a new start
Due to my past transgressions, you believed in me
I guess the light I see in you is what you see in me, Lord

[Pre-Chorus: J. Cole]
Say she from the west side, mmmm
And she seen my best side, mmmm, mmm

[Chorus: 6LACK]
Now I just wanna know
Don't you sugarcoat
I'll say it all if you want
Now could you tell me like it is?
Pretty little fears
Music to my ears

Burn Out (feat. Dewain Whitmore) by Martin Garrix

[Verse 1]
Flash fire, I'm coming for ya
You're gonna feel me like the summer, like the sun in your eyes
Hold tight, another minute
Another hour, baby, I'ma show you

[Pre-Chorus]
You can rely on me
I'll give you all you need
In a smoke cloud, tryin' to find ground
In a place where we belong

[Chorus]
We don't have to dream to make it beautiful
Baby, everything we do is beautiful
We can light a fire, watch it everglow
We won't burn out, we won't burn out
We won't burn out, we won't burn out

[Post-Chorus]
We won't burn out, we won't burn out

[Verse 2]
Won't take a million dollars
For us to have a kind of life you only see in a dream
Wake up, 'cause now you're in it
I wanna show you all the magic in the air

[Pre-Chorus]
And tonight it's free
It'll be all you need
In a smoke cloud, tryin' to find ground
In a place where we belong

[Chorus]
We don't have to dream to make it beautiful
Baby, everything we do is beautiful
We can light a fire, watch it everglow
We won't burn out, we won't burn out
We won't burn out, we won't burn out
We won't burn out, we won't burn out

[Post-Chorus]
We won't burn out, we won't burn out

Mariners Apartment Complex by Lana Del Rey

[Verse 1]
You took my sadness out of context
At the Mariners Apartment Complex
I ain't no candle in the wind
I'm the board, the lightning, the thunder
Kind of girl who's gonna make you wonder
Who you are and who you've been

[Pre-Chorus]
And who I've been is with you on these beaches
Your Venice bitch, your die-hard, your weakness
Maybe I could save you from your sins
So kiss the sky and whisper to Jesus
My, my, my, you found this, you need this
Take a deep breath, baby, let me in

[Chorus]
You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man

[Verse 2]
They mistook my kindness for weakness
I fucked up, I know that, but Jesus
Can't a girl just do the best she can?
Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Think about it, the darkness, the deepness
All the things that make me who I am

[Pre-Chorus]
And who I am is a big-time believer
That people can change, but you don't have to leave her
When everyone's talking, you can make a stand
'Cause even in the dark, I feel your resistance
You can see my heart burning in the distance
Baby, baby, baby, I'm your man (Yeah)

[Chorus]
You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man

[Outro]
Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Take in the sweetness
You want this, you need this
Are you ready for it?
Are you ready for it?
Are you ready for it?

Side Effects (feat. Emily Warren) by The Chainsmokers

[Verse 1]
It's 4AM, I don't know where to go
Everywhere is closed, I should just go home, yeah
My feet are taking me to your front door
I know I shouldn't though, heaven only knows

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That ooh, the side effect to my loneliness is you

Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight

Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight

[Bridge]
Time should've taught me the lesson
Went looking for a sign, but instead I got a message
I take off my pride every time we undressing
Draw the line, I'm by the line (yeah)
Time should've taught me the lesson
Went looking for a sign, but instead I got a message
I take off my pride every time we undressing
Draw the line, I'm by the line

[Chorus 2]
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight, yeah
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight, yeah
I, I think about it all the time
Make it happen in my mind, I'm telling you, yeah
Ooh, you're all that I want
No good at giving you up
Come on and give me some love tonight

[Outro]
Time should've taught me the lesson
Went looking for a sign, but instead I got a message
I take off my pride every time we undressing
Draw the line, I'm by the line, yeah
Time should've taught me the lesson
Went looking for a sign, but instead I got a message
I take off my pride every time we undressing
Draw the line, I'm by the line, yeah

Guiding Light by Mumford & Sons

[Intro]
1, 2, 3

[Verse 1]
All day permanent red
The glaze on my eyes
When I heard your voice
The distance caught me by surprise again
And I know you claim that you're alright

[Verse 2]
But fix your eyes on me
I guess I'm all you have
And I swear you'll see the dawn again

[Chorus]
Well I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light

[Verse 3]
Relate to my youth
Well I'm still in awe of you
Discover some new truth
That was always wrapped around you

[Verse 4]
But don t just slip away in the night
And don t just hurl your words from on high

[Chorus]
Well I know I had it all on the line
But don t just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light

[Bridge]
If we come back and we re broken
Unworthy and ashamed
Give us something to believe in
And you know we ll go your way

[Chorus]
'Cause I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light
And I know I had it all on the line
But don't just sit with folded hands and become blind
'Cause even when there is no star in sight
You'll always be my only guiding light

Dark Side Of The Moon (feat. Nicki Minaj) by Lil Wayne

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
As I wipe the stars off the windows on my space ship
Call out the spirits in my basement
Crawl out the center of the snake pit
And fall into the middle of her greatness
Fireballs reflect off the frames of the pictures
She's not at all impressed with the flames or the flickers
But take her for a walk on the moon as she wear slippers
The end of the world is coming soon, I ma miss it
The sky is falling down, I am falling for her quicker
We hide amongst the clouds, then we pardon the enigma
High above the ground but I'm under her charisma
Her sound is in surround when I'm in her solar system
The quiet calms my quasars, the eclipse is eclipsin 
My astronaut helmet kinda shifted, full of lipstick
Planet of the aches, and she is my prescription
We out of this world, baby, we have been evicted

[Chorus: Lil Wayne / Lil Wayne & Nicki Minaj]
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, intergalactical, intergalactical love
And I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Open up the curtains
Window-watchin', people killin', robbin 
The sky is fallin , fallin' down
I tune into news, and this is the apocalypse
People livin  on their rocket ships
My mama always told me that there would be no stoppin' this
Fireball reflections on the friends and the pictures in my room
Of I and you
Tell me, will I see you soon?
Meet you on the moon?

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & (Lil Wayne) / Both]
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, falling down
I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
I'll be waiting, I ll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, intergalactic, intergalactical love
And I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Famous (feat. Reginae Carter) by Lil Wayne

[Chorus: Reginae Carter]
Welcome to your name in lights
All the lighters in the sky (Yeah)
You must be famous
This is how you live your life, different city every night (Yeah)
You must be famous, famous

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'ma be on the TV, mama, Pac voice
People point at me, say, "Oh my God"
They got a point
Tried to blow my nose and blew my mind
It's mind-blowing
And gold diggers dig until they find oil
And I'm sittin' here reading what was written 'bout what I do, what I didn't
I ruined relationships before my image, but
All I ever wanted was everybody's attention
'Cause most people are nobody 'til somebody kill 'em
Probably thought that my career be short and sweet
Wishin' I was in your shoes, I'd take them off and find a beach
And superstars don't sparkle, we high-beam
And you can't spell fame, without me
And may my Hall of Fame speech be short and sweet
Like, "Thank God, fuck fame, and thank me"
'Cause superstars don't sparkle, superstars beam
I was your main man, 'til I went mainstream
I'ma be on the TV, mama

[Chorus: Reginae Carter & Lil Wayne]
Welcome to your name in lights (Woo!)
All the lighters in the sky (I must be famous)
You must be famous (Yeah, oh my God I must be famous)
This is how you live your life (Yeah)
Different city every night (I must be famous)
You must be famous, famous

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Rich and famous, it's better to be rich and famous
Message to my lawyer: "Don't let me make these bitches famous"
You know entertainers, sex, drugs and entertainment get so instantaneous
Simultaneous, miscellaneous, party long and hard
And pray death is quick and painless
Livin' in the spotlight, twist the light bulb when it's blinking
I'm never alone
I got my demons and my angels
Can't talk to myself, 'cause mama said don't talk to strangers
Relatives; ain't seen 'em since the grass been greener
And some people say I changed but they can't hear me jingle
I want Tina and Nancy, I get Nancy and Tina
Never question myself, unless I ask, "Am I dreamin'?"
The fan mail and subpoenas, jail cells to arenas
Car wash to the cleaners, Walmart to Neiman's
They told me time would tell
I told time to kiss my ass
And I heard, "Can you look this way? Can you look this way?"
Flash! I must be famous

[Chorus: Reginae Carter & Lil Wayne]
Welcome to your name in lights (Yeah!)
All the lighters in the sky (You must be famous)
You must be famous (I'ma be on the TV, mama!)
This is how you live your life (Yeah, yeah)
Different city every night (Oh my God, I must be famous)
You must be famous, famous

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
You probably thought that my career, be short and sweet
You wish that I was in your shoes, I'd take them off 'cause life's a beach
And superstars don't sparkle, we shine deep
And you can't spell fame, without me
And may my Hall of Fame speech be short and sweet
Like, "Thank God, fuck fame, and thank me"
'Cause superstars don't twinkle, superstars gleam
I was your main man, 'til I went mainstream
I'ma be on the TV, mama

[Chorus: Reginae Carter & Lil Wayne]
Welcome to your name in lights
All the lighters in the sky (Oh my God, I must be famous)
You must be famous (Oh my God, I must be famous)
This is how you live your life
Different city every night (Oh my God, I must be famous)
You must be famous, famous

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
I'ma be on the TV, mama
Kiss my motherfuckin' ass

Dope Niggaz (feat. Snoop Dogg) by Lil Wayne

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, I thank the Lord I'm not a broke nigga, I m dope, nigga
Change my name, I ain't like average Joe, nigga
Up above wit' my above average ho, nigga
Tight frame with a tight cameltoe, nigga
I got killers on the front line, you on the sideline
Follow the guidelines or you be in the skyline
Killas on the inside, and on your blindside
Shoot you right between your motherfuckin  eyebrows
Ooh, kill 'em - It's that "Carter V", let me get 'em
I'm feeling like John Gotti Lennon
And you gon' respect my mind and my sign and my emblem
You got money on your mind and we aimin' at your temple
Check me out or just be quiet in the library, nigga
Or the flowers on your grave gon' be dyin  every winter
And as long as I m alive I'm a financial wizard
Long as I can make a dollar out a dime and a nickle
Thank the Lord I m not a broke nigga

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
I get money, I'm a hustler
So if you buyin' what I'm sellin , you a customer
See I can get it to you anywhere, anything
But it's point-blank range when the pistol bang
I mix it up, I fix it up and I switched it up
I locked down this end and got it twisted up
See I'm a dog, but I loc with my locs
They say, "You are what you smoke"

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I grew up around dope niggas
Uh, uh, uh, dope niggas
I grew up around dope niggas

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, I grew up around dope niggas and cold killers
And most niggas was both, nigga, two sport niggas
I was no different from those niggas, but I was chose, nigga
See those niggas somewhere with me in these hoes, nigga
Momma was a go-getter, a coach, nigga
Taught me everything I know, nigga, a soul sister
Taught me how to be a goal tender, support system
For that bitch, you played her role with ya and those children
I ain't lyin', slime, all my niggas balling, it's a fuckin' team sport
I could change the world, but I done lost the remote
All my niggas balling, that's how it's supposed to be, ho
I could change the world, I'd rather change to beast mode
Coke sniffers and dope stickers
And most niggas was both, nigga, explode, nigga
Pop a motherfuckin' cork, nigga, to those niggas
'Cause life's too fuckin' short, nigga, get old, nigga
I ain't lyin', got a gold mirror just to see my goals clearer
Be a role player, role model, while you roll with 'em
They say you don't need to be with us, stay on the road, nigga
That way I wouldn't come to the end of the road with 'em
Man, all my niggas targets, that's includin' me, ho
I could change the world, I'd rather change the people
And definitions 'cause we're defined by our legal roles
All your haters fuelin', my needle broke
Lord, I ain't a broke nigga

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I thank the Lord I ain't a broke nigga
I thank the Lord I ain't a broke nigga

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Lil Wayne]
I get money, I'm a hustler
So if you buyin' what I'm sellin', you a customer

But it's point-blank range when the pistol bang
I thank the Lord I ain't a broke nigga
I mix it up, I fix it up and I switched it up
I locked down this end and got it twisted up
See I'm a dog, but I loc with my locs
They say, "You are what you smoke"

Uh, uh, uh, dope niggas

Open Letter by Lil Wayne

[Intro]
Ah-em

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like I ain't shit
Sometimes a nigga feel like shit
Talkin  'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, "Dear Life" shit
So if a nigga kill me, hope he mean it
I just hope I die for a reason
They probably won't miss me  til they need me
Have problems with admittin' that they need me, Lord
I'm talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, "Dear Life" shit
Way too concerned to be conceited
I live and I learn, then die tryna teach 'em, Lord
Die tryna reach 'em
They care more about how much I leave than
Where I leave it
I hope I leave more of an impression on my kids
To be destined to have blessings to believe in, Lord
Just got off the phone with my son
Told him, "You're a son of a gun"
Just got off the phone with my daughter
Told her, "I won t hesitate to fuck a young nigga up", Lord
A few bitches left me, yhat only got a new bitch elected
My old bitch was too disrespectful
And only get my new bitch respected
That s power, yes, it's now or next
Can t lie though, I tried though
I'll die tryin', that's a common death
We was such a team, we was chasin  our dreams
Then it stopped, now I'm outta breath
Now they try to tell me I need rest
And I'll find love again, I ain't find it yet
Oh, but I guess it is what it is as it appears, oh shit
The object in the mirror is more near than it appears, oh shit
And sometimes I fear who in the mirror, that nigga weird
He done died so many times but still here, why am I here?

[Chorus]
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?

[Verse 2]
Naked bitches really love ones
Sometimes our loved ones don't love us
I'm fuckin' more than I'm makin' love
Sometimes I make my rubber wear a rubber
I just tell my lady, "Nothing's easy"
Even though I make it look easy
But understand looks are deceiving
Lookin' like I'm lookin' for some grievance
'Cause I been through way too much, don't wanna think about it
Cranky 'bout it, gotta drink about it
Gotta synchronize it, tranquilize it
Doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'
Pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me
Tryna hang my body, sanctifyin'
I'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die
I can't deny it, you can't tame my lion
I'm a angry lion hangin' by a string, I can't describe it
Feel like a anchor tied to my finger
Got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink
I know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas
There's strength in numbers but there's honor over strength
I talked to God the other day, he say he got a nigga
So, I look death up in her eye and then I wink
It's way too real, the shit I'm talkin' way, way too real
I hope it gave you chills
The dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill
You don't know how dead you feel 'til you're dead for real
Gettin' high after I paid the bill, lower than a Navy SEAL
Show up with them Navy guns, I hope somebody prayin' for 'em
Price tags on mistakes, somebody payin' for 'em
Ice bath when my face numb, no expression
What's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?
Mama told me, "Fuck the world and be so aggressive
Be so fluorescent, watch these hoes 'cause they so obsessive
Don't get too high to look over blessings
Never come in second, make the most of your seconds
They so precious"
'Cause if we could buy time, every store would sell it
If you want me to read your mind, need correct spelling
I keep it real, niggas better keep it copacetic
Where the weed? I feel like I'm gettin' sober-headed
Lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better
I was too busy to talk, I wrote an open letter

[Chorus]
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question I ask the reader, God bless the reader
Dear Life, what is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question

[Outro: Jacida Carter]
You know, when he told me Toya was havin' a baby, I say, "Y'all young. You know y'all young." But I said, "Be the best father you can be," you know. And truly, he is that.

Shallow by Lady Gaga

[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm fallin'
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And in the bad times, I fear myself

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm fallin'
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
In the sha-ha, sha-la-low
In the sha-sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-ha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Hoo, huh, uh, huhh-ow
Huh, huhh-huhhh

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
In the sha-ha, sha-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, sha-ha-low
We're far from the shallow now

[Intro]
Zaytoven

[Chorus]
If lovin' me is wrong, I don t wanna be right, damn bitch, you hatin'
I'm never wrong, one time I thought I was wrong and I was only mistaken
I live all alone, no house telephone, talk to you later
I m never home, one time I thought I was home and it was only the matrix

[Verse 1]
Off button, pause button, stop button, lock button
Belly button, big ol' titties, she pop buttons, head buttin'
Versace button down unbuttoned to the top button
Percocets, that's my buttons, hit the pop button
Psychopath, blunt big, big as Mama June off the diet plan
Smokin' science lab
I should have a tattoo that say, "I am nothin' like my dad"
Jesus Christ, amen
My hand in the psychic's hand, she see righteous plans
I see business plans then I lose my mind and my attention span
She see empty hands like, "Oooh, Lordy," smellin' like Cool Water
Just got them new Cartier, the Rollie was too salty
That s rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
My little bitch body a trophy
Naked pics, five in the morning, sunglasses, smilin  emoji
Pull up on the opps, surprise party
Better get up and stand up like Bob Marley
That is your homie, he died for ya
Check your home screen, that's God callin  (Hello?)
We makin' an impact, my nigga
We not just black, nigga, we rich and black, nigga
And all them bitches they been after niggas
They run away then they come limpin' back, nigga
Amen, feeling like Our Father
Should I get off my high horse to get on my flyin' horses?
That s rich nigga problems, lil whoadie

I live all alone, no house telephone, talk to you later
I'm never home every time I thought I was home it was only the matrix

[Verse 2]
Rest in peace, I rest in peace and harmony
I don't talk, I speak, after I pray, I preach
I don't play, I cheat, after I stay, I leave
The fork in the road, grab the fork and eat
Turn that piggy bank to some hog head cheese
But you doin' nothing, well they say, "Nothin' ain't never worth nothin', but it's always free"
Psychopath
Blunt thick, thick as Mama June off the diet plan, smokin' science lab
I should have tattoo that say, "I'm nothin' like your man"
Jesus Christ, Amen!
My hand in the psychic' hand
She see righteous plans, I see power plans
She take my hands put 'em in her pants
Do the hyphy dance then I wipe my hands
Feeling like Our Father
Should I get off my high horse to get on my flyin' horses?
That's rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
That's rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
Rich nigga problems, lil whoadie
Rich nigga problems, lil whoadie

If lovin' me is wrong, I don't wanna be right, damn bitch, you hatin'
I'm never wrong, one time thought I was wrong and I was only mistaken
I live all alone, no house telephone, talk to you later
I'm never home, one time I thought I was home and it was only the matrix

Hittas by Lil Wayne

[Sample: Lil Wayne & David Letterman]
Is it true you performed with Willie Nelson at the Country Music Awards?
I don't know, but I know I did perform at this bad ass bitch birthday party recently. She was crazy, stupid thick

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Mack in here
Pooh in here
Scoob in here with me

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tell them hoes get they mind right, tell them niggas back up
Man, I heard the truth is hard to swallow, do you have cups?
Used the rope to hang myself to tie a money bag up
Tell  em get they iron right before Iron-Man come
Tell 'em bring my car around, tell 'em bitches lap up
I ma cut this music down, tell 'em put they APs up
Tell 'em throw they pride out, roll the windows back up
Money in the air, who said white men can't jump?
Catch that nigga late night on the phone at a gas pump
Let me get the phone and the car once it's gassed up
AK-47 make a sittin' duck stand up
I could let it blast, but I much rather have one
Tell 'em bring my car around, tell 'em bitches lap up
Then them hoes get passed down, then them hoes get passed up
Sittin  on this money to me feel like a cactus
I m stickin' to this shit, you would ve been have hopped yo' ass up

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Tell 'em, I got hittas woadie (Hittas woadie)
I got, yeah I got plenty woadie
I got hittas woadie (Hittas woadie)
I got, yeah I got plenty woadie (Plenty woadie)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne & Katie Couric]
I got hittas woadie, yeah I got plenty woadie
And they just wait for the word, this shit like Wheel of Fortune
Goddamn, these snitches nosy, goddamn, these snitches nosy
Nigga, I'm a ass with that semi; call me semicolon
Yeah I got hittas woadie, yeah I got plenty woadie
They kick the door and kill yo  ass and leave the children snorin'
I'm sippin' lean out a glass, make me feel important
I made some green in the past and now it's good as golden
Yeah, clearly, Lil Wayne answers to no one

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I got hittas woadie
I got, yeah I got plenty woadie (Plenty woadie)
I got hittas woadie (Hittas woadie)
I got, yeah I got plenty woadie

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne & Drake]
I'm so lifted, I'm so lifted
I wrote my will in hieroglyphics (In hieroglyphics)
Weezy, where you been? The people miss you
Crickets
I got hittas and they not kidders, that's my niggas
You got niggas but they not hittas, they got jitters
They get hit up, I'm placin' figures on your niggas
Takin' bidders, yo' bae, yo' niggas, don't make a difference
I got shooters, on pharmaceuticals , they armed and brutal
Armed intruders, 'cause we don't doodle, we draw conclusions
I got sprayers, all type of sprayers, we gon' need Google
I got paper, on top of paper, we gon' need rulers
I'm effective, been doin' numbers since Roman numerals
Strong as sumo, we armed as usual, my hittas hungry
Charleston Chew you, bazookas chew you, just like Bazookas
Don't confuse 'em, we only hittas, y'all only humans
Don't get hit up, woadie (Hit up, woadie, hit up, woadie)
'Cause I got hittas woadie

[Outro: Jacida Carter]
He's a very smart child. And I just said he was a genius, you know what I'm sayin'? Which I used to pray, and ask the Lord to send me one. You know, he did. He's so smart, I can't teach him nothin'. He's done been here before

New money, call it cake, fresh-baked, nigga
Hungry, bullets eatin' off your chest-plate, nigga
I hope this bitch don't think that I'mma have faith in her (No-no)
Bitch screamed when the dick was halfway in her

[Verse 2]
When the dick was halfway in her
Damn, you ain't dead yet? I'm amazed, nigga
Guess what? I'm comin' back with that gauge, nigga
Leather face, but I m feeling like suede nigga
Got you dizzy, turning over in your grave, nigga
I could shoot this bitch and still drive straight, nigga
Bap, bap, bap, bap, I'm irate, nigga

Bumbu out the glass, no chase, nigga (Bumbu)
Only smoke on gas, no brakes, nigga
No brakes, road rage, my new money gonna die of old age
When they shoot, we don't race, we gon' need our own space
Need a piece of that pie, we gon' need it homemade
I be comin' home late, bad bitch, long face
She do every single thing but rub me the wrong way
'96 Dom P, I have that with Corn Flakes
And I never been intrigued by the patterns on snakes
You could dump a dead body, man, I think I know a place
She gon' suck the prototype then swallow all the proteges, nigga

[Chorus 2]
Lookin' like a open safe, nigga
We in this bitch, lookin' like Miss Oprah's safe, nigga (We're safe)
My homie caught a whole case (Whole case)
Celebratin' like he got a cold case, nigga (Oh!)
Whew, wait, nigga
Had to take a smoke break, nigga
A smoke break, nigga

[Verse 3]
I stick her hands in the fan blades, nigga
That's when she told me where her man stayed, nigga
I ran up in that bitch on a rampage, nigga
In the morning, brains in the pancakes, nigga
My bitch classy and she keep her classmates with her
Your bitch ashy and she keep a ashtray with her
Had to do it one time for my skate niggas
Skate up on you, blam-blam, skate away, nigga
Kick push, that means grind and get paid, nigga
These pay cuts bleed through the Band-Aid, nigga
So walk it like you talk it, sashay, nigga
Skate up on you, blam-blam
Okay nigga, I just left José nigga, I just left José, nigga
Federales on my ass, fuckin' had a boat chase, nigga
They didn't see no face, nigga
Your bitch spent the whole day with us
If she open her fuckin' mouth, knock all the white out, no racism
That's cold, homies, pump that bass, nigga
And sometimes we close the safe, nigga
But there ain't no code to break, niggas
I capitalize off my own mistakes, you lowercase, nigga
Your bitch cut her legs when they was on my shoulder blades, nigga
Don't hate (Don't hate) call an ace, an ace, nigga
Got Mack with me up in this bitch and a MAC just in case, nigga
I'm a Scarface, nigga, fuck your human race, nigga
I'm on base, nigga, yeah Lil Tunechi safe, nigga

[Chorus 3]

If I'm Lyin, I'm Flyin by Kodak Black

[Intro]
Glee

[Verse]
I can't let these niggas knock me off my pivot
God sat me down and talked to me, I listened
I was in that cell, he told me that I m gifted
I don't make it in the booth, then I'ma make it in the kitchen
I m special with the mic, special with the whippin'
I ran out of money, had to pay attention
All the people that was 'round me, they ain't have my best interest
You ain't have my best interest
You lazy with yo' loyalty and yo' position
And now I gotta execute 'cause you don t listen
That throwaway on me dumpin  with precision
I know shawty only on my trail 'cause she see a ticket
I m readin' between the lines and peepin' they intentions
Can't have you niggas around me, shit gon  go to missing
I had to press that bump, I had to feel it
You know if it ever come down to it, a nigga with it
All these drugs got the whole world jiggy
Hoes comin' out they clothes and niggas trippin'
Why hit the top to go back to the bottom?
All these bitches fallin' for me like it's Autumn
I'm tryna tell you, homie, you don't want none
They freed me so I'm right back to that mon-yun
Somebody tell these niggas they don't want none
Kodak Black but I'm spreadin' blue hundons
They sent my nigga Cool on the fuckin' run
When they let him out of prison, I'll be 31
I knew I was a star when I was sellin' hard
Everybody told me I would make it when I was on the block
See, before this rap shit, I was jackin' cars
I couldn't get all my time 'cause I was doin' fraud
Me and my nigga Lil' Marcus tearin' up the Wyatt
It hurt me to my heart, heard they gave him 25
I'm from the Noya, all I know is slang that iron

[Outro]
Just like I told you, if I'm lyin' then I'm flyin'
Just like I told you, if I'm lyin' then I'm flyin'
Just like I told you, if I'm lyin' then I'm flyin'

Took His Time by Lil Wayne

[Chorus]
Momma said God took his time when he made me
I put my pride to the side, off safety
I'm on a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat
Momma said God took his time when he made me
I put my pride to the side, off safety
I'm on a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat
Momma said God took his time when he made me (Yeah)
God took his time when he made me
I put my pride to the side, off safety
And look alive, look alive

[Verse 1]
Smoke one, ready to po' one, tote one, scared of no one
You never know when your close ones is a pussy 'til your nose run
Bickin' back bein' bool, trigger happy his goons
Bigger mansion and pool, I need a map for this room
Don't need a casket to view 'em, you can leave the rats in the sewers
I'm speedin' past in the newest soft top like the Jewish
Thrasher Sweatshirt, Vans on, all the bitches hands on
Fucked your bitch for a Sams card, a SIM card and an Android
Shots all in the airway, bullets make 'em do ballet
Pullin' triggers like hairspray, shoot 'em in the head, bad hair day
In broad day like "let's play," lil' kids playin' jump rope
Leave his body on the front porch, it's a cold world but the sun show
Where the paper and the drugs though, at your neighbor with the snub-nose
I be seen with the unseen, you be seen with the unknowns
All your bitches in the done zone, all my bitches in the fun zone
Swallowin' all my unborns, say it taste like a love song
In the cut like a cutworm, keep it cool, keep the cup warm
Rum-bum-bum-bum-bum, if they come for 'em, I tell 'em

[Chorus]
God took his time when he made me
Got my pride to the side, off safety
On a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat
Momma said God took his time when he made me
Pride to the side, off safety
On a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat
Momma said God took his time when he made me
God took his time when he made me

[Verse 2]
Sorry, boys, bar is closin', where we goin' for breakfast?
Put pressure on the precious, and put extra on the extras
Extra ready for my presents, extra sexy but she selfish
Just want me to see selfies of the pelvis, overwhelmin'
Talkin' money over salmon in Italian in Australia
Fuck it even have some salad, I'm just valuin' the value
Wake up and smell the azaleas sang her prayers like Mahalia
I just don't know what to tell ya, but, hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Devil lies jumpin' at ya, comin' from what's comin' at ya
I come from where they come at ya, in a way you can't come back from
I attack from every crack, while you been chillin', I been active
I been still inside the action, you been actin' I been buildin'
You been blabbin', you been bickerin'
I been blackin' I been sippin' like the Dracula
I been feelin' like Galactus
Got a million in the mattress, a gazillion in the pantry
If you don't know that I'm the answer, you should kill who you been askin'

[Chorus]
Momma said God took his time when he made me
I put my pride to the side, off safety
I'm on a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat
Momma said God took his time when he made me
Pride to the side, off safety
On a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat
Momma said God took his time when he made me
God took his time when he made me
Pride to the side, off safety
Look alive, look alive

[Outro]
Look alive, look alive, yeah
Look alive, look alive
Momma said God took his time when he made me
Look alive, look alive
Carter Five, Carter Five, yeah
Carter Five, Carter Five
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Let It All Work Out by Lil Wayne

[Intro: Sampha]
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Work out, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'm in this bitch
Yeah, was on the outside, looking in this bitch
But now I m in this bitch
Yeah, I'm in this bitch
Tunechi, you a genius
Looked in the mirror said
"Don't let the money come between us"
I m loaded, loaded at my earliest convenience
But fuck 'em, I feel like I got ten middle fingers
I'm sippin', sippin' in this bitch and poppin' uppers
Girl, take this, this that shit that give a flower color
And some bitch named Wonder Woman told me not to wonder
The crumbs, you only see 'em when the cookie crumble
Real shit, nigga, my candle still lit
Had to swallow my pride, though, swear it tastes like spearmint
Big up to my nigga with a strap on 'em
I never turn my back on  em
 Cause nigga act like they cool with ya
But a lot of these niggas be transformers
A lot of these players be bench-warmers
The game ain't easy, but it s fair, nigga
I'mma sit in this throne so long
'Til it's a fucking rocking chair, nigga
Bad bitch play with my hair, nigga
Said, "Relax, Tune, baby don t stress out"
But I got a lot of shit on my mind, though
She said, "Let that shit work itself out"
"Let that shit work itself out"

[Interlude 1: Lil Wayne & Sampha]
C5
Yeah, back in this bitch
Tune you left this bitch
Like you knew this bitch was gon' let your ass back in this bitch
Let it all work out, let it all work out
But ain't nobody else like you in this bitch
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out
Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Cita, you a psychic
'Cause you said there be days like this
They want a piece of me, I ain't the one that's serving slices
Please swallow, I had my share of dirty diapers
Real shit, pussy niggas on that guilt trip
It'll be on in a heartbeat
You can't hear no pussy nigga's shit skip
I fear God, never fear men
Give back, never give in
Beat odds, never beat women
Keep an open mind, let 'em peek in it
Reach highs, never reach limits
Need minds, I don't need plenty
This C5, this for BI and Left Eye, and T-Boz
When I seen Chilli at the Floyd fight
I almost asked her to creep with me
But I was young, and I held my tongue
But with that tongue, I just keep spitting
So it all worked out

[Interlude 2: Lil Wayne & Sampha]
And now I'm in this bitch
And life said, "Tune, you knew me for way too long"
I never change, you know I been this bitch
And then she said, "Let it all work out"
"Let it all work out, let it all work out" (Yeah)
"Let it all work out, let it all work out"

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi, you a monster
Looked in the mirror, but you wasn't there, I couldn't find ya
I'm lookin' for that big, old smile, full of diamonds
Instead, I found this letter you ain't finished writin'
It read, "I'm sorry for even apologizing"
I tried, compromising and went kamikaze
I found my momma's pistol where she always hide it
I cry, put it to my head and thought about it
Nobody was home to stop me, so I called my auntie
Hung up, then put the gun up to my heart and pondered
Too much was on my conscience to be smart about it
Too torn apart about it, I aim where my heart was pounding
I shot it, and I woke up with blood all around me
It's mine, I didn't die, but as I was dying
God came to my side and we talked about it
He sold me another life and he made a prophet

[Outro: Lil Wayne & Sampha & Jacida Carter]
Yeah, and he said
"Let it all work out" (Yeah)
"Let it all work out"
(I'm still in this bitch)
"Let it all work out"
(Yeah, thank God 'cause I'm still in this bitch)
"Let it all work out"
Let it all work out (Phew)
"Let it all work out"
(But he said, "Remember this:")
"Let it all work out"
"Let it all work out"
("Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch")
"Let it all work out" (Yeah)

Mess by Lil Wayne

[Chorus]
Because my days is a mess
My nights is a mess, my life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness
Lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
Fuck it, my bae is a mess
My side bitch a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gon' have to excuse my mess

[Verse 1]
She gon' have to excuse my ex
I'ma have to excuse her pets
She gon' have to be juicy wet if she gon' ride on this Tune Express
I'ma have to excuse her text
She gon' have to exclude the rest
She gon' have to tell dudes to step
Nigga, to the left, nigga, to the left
Messy, messy on some Percocets
Smoking purple veggie, that's my herbal essence
With a curvy, sexy woman hurting extra 'cause I'm working extra
I just heard her lecture, but I swerved the questions
And reserved a section with a bunch of bitches that prefer the pleasure
It's quarter-to-seven
They just heard the shower water runnin' in the morning
Dirty Devil, I'm a mess

[Bridge]
But I'm sorry babe, but I gotta let go
Now she feel like she on death row
She don't believe in ghosts 'til I get ghost
And I can hear her teardrops echo
Her teardrops turn into XO
Put yourself in my shoes but you got to tiptoe

[Chorus]
'Cause my days is a mess
My nights is a mess, my life is a mess
My life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness
Lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
But fuck it, more one's, my bae is a mess
My side bitch a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gon' have to excuse my mess

[Verse 2]
Yes, no pressure, it s a jungle out here
Fell in love with a stripper, Lord, I know she got bills
But I'ma make it rain until she see a flood of ideas
Got me all up in my feelings without knowing what I feel
I'm a mess
And now she over talking about staying over
And she ask could she call her clan over?
I say that's the shit and now we asshole-ing
Now fast forward 'til the morning time
Broken glasses with a bunch of ashes, makeup, and lashes
Out of place mattress, shit happens 'cause my days is a mess

[Bridge]
I'm sorry babe, but I gotta let go
Now she feel like she on death row
She don't believe in ghosts 'til I get ghost
And I can hear her teardrops echo
Her teardrops turn into Petrol
Put yourself in my shoes but you got to tiptoe

[Chorus]
'Cause my days is a mess
My nights is a mess, my life is a mess
My life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness
Lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
But fuck it, more one's, my bae is a mess
My side bitch a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey care less
But you gon' have to excuse my mess

[Outro]
Yes, fuck it, more ones, fuck it, more ones
Fuck it more ones, fuck it, more ones
I'm  making a mess with all of these ones
Fuck it, more ones, fuck it, more ones
My life is a mess of happiness
Lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
But fuck it, more one's

Used 2 by Lil Wayne

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I used to smoke to get high, now I smoke to get vibes
I used to tote the semi, I still tote the semi
I used to walk a thin line, now I'm walking chin high
I used to fuck and get tired, now I fuck her ten times
She used to make me dick rise, now she make me ribeyes
She used to make me six-nine, now she make her friend try
She used to make me love her, now she make me realize
It's money over bitches 'till the day I dizz-ie
Keep it on the East Side, keep it on the B-side
I feel like Ivan Drago, if he dies, he dies

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Find out where he reside and find out where he hide
Run up in that bitch like, "Hey," pop-pop-pop, peace sign
Percocet, promethazine, you can call me P-Rod
Taking shots at my team, you must be getting senile
You goin' at my slime then you're going at me, slime
Your blood all over the scene, it look like red cheap wine
I'm smoking on a key lime, you look like tea time
Look like honey to my beehive, I close your sweet eyes
Shoot ya in ya head, give ya ass three eyes
And you still ain't seen a fucking thing until you C5
I remember you, I was never into you
I tell my shooters, shoot you and whoever resemble you
And every member who had been a friend of you or kin to you
They in it too, and bitches too, they mention you, they dentures loose
Run up in a nigga house, pistol in that nigga mouth
Safe code now nigga, cough it up or spit it out
Oh my God I'm flipping out, flipping out then dipping out
I tried to turn the fuckin' page, oh my God, I ripped it out

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I used to smoke to get high, now I smoke to get vibes
I used to tote the semi, I still tote the semi
Keep it on the East Side, keep it on the B-side
I feel like Ivan Drago, lil bitch, and if he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
Yeah, run up in that nigga house, pistol in that nigga mouth
But he be talking out his ass, what is all that shit about?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I used to know you niggas, I don't know you niggas
I just ignore you niggas, I don't bro you niggas
With my bros will smoke you niggas, like we grow you niggas
Kill your ho too nigga, and your go-to niggas
I've been riding 'round the city with the safety off
Glock nine and it's pretty like a baby doll
You niggas bitches and it's pissing all the ladies off
My finger sitting on the trigger like a La-Z-Boy
If there was beef, I'm in the kitchen with the apron on
Put his words on the plate, that nigga ate 'em all
And I ain't wit' the talking, but damn now he talking
Nigga spilled the beans, damn, now it's coffee
Looking for your pussy ass like I got a warrant
I throw on the ski mask, that's a private party
Bullets jumping off your ass like they shock absorbant
Rock your bells, LL, nigga locked and loaded

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I used to smoke to get high now I smoke to get vibes
I used to tote the semi, I still tote the semi
Keep it on the East Side, keep it on the beast side
I feel like Ivan Drago lil bitch, and if he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
Yeah run up in that nigga house, pistol in that nigga mouth
But he be talking out his ass, what is all that shit about?
I used to smoke to get high, now I smoke to get vibes
Used to tote the semi, I still tote the semi
Keep it on the East Side, keep it on the B-side
I feel like Ivan Drago lil bitch, and if he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
If he dies, he dies
Yeah, run up in that nigga house, pistol in that nigga mouth
But he be talking out his ass, what is all that shit about?

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Mulah, baby
And you still ain't seen a fucking thing until you C5

[Skit: Jacida Carter]
I still don't know today
Was he playing with the gun or was it an accident
I still... I just don't.... I.... I be wanting to ask him but I never asked him after all these years
Was that a accident or did he... or was he playing with the gun
So I never really found out about what...
You know what happ-... what really happened with him and that shooting

Demon by Lil Wayne

[Verse 1]
Sleepin' with the enemy, my demons are too intimate
She's sleepin' very gently so now they're startin' to enter it
And now they're startin' to mentor me, geekin  like Brittany
Tweakin' my energy, eat and die sympathy
Scream and cry infamy, come alive mentally
And love die physically, my love cry miserably
Hugs gettin' looser, her tongue tied kissin' me
She fucked thy niggas, see now they both iggin' me
But demons got dignity, demons got memories
I had a lil' revenge in me, so now I'm at sentencin'
'Bout to stop gigglin' and dinner start sizzlin'

[Bridge]
A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands
She agree to my demands too
Brought the demon out her ass too
I'm a demon, I demand you

[Chorus]
A demon with demands, a demon with demands
I'm a demon with demands, I got demons on demand
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm a demon, I demand you
You brought the demon out the man, ooh
Brought the demon out the man, ooh
The demon out the man, you
Brought the demon out the man, ooh

[Refrain]
You done pulled the demon out the man, pulled the demon out the pants
Put the demon in your mouth then pulled it clean up out your ass
Took her demon by the hands, asked the demon, "Can we dance?"
Found a halo in her trash but she don't talk about her past

[Bridge 2]
A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands
A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands

[Chorus 2]
A demon with demands, a demon with demands
I'm a demon with demands, I got demons on demand
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm a demon by demand too
Yeah, brought the demon out the man, ooh
She agree to my demands too
You done brought the demon out the man, ooh
Brought the demon out her ass too

[Verse 2]
Sleepin' with the enemy, my demons are too intimate
She's sleepin' very gently, so now they're startin' to enter it

[Bridge 3]
A demon, with demands

[Refrain]
You done pulled the demon out the man, pulled the demon out the pants
Put the demon in your mouth then pulled it clean up out your ass
Took her demon by the hands, asked the demon, "Can we dance?"
Found a halo in her trash but she don't talk about her past

[Outro]
Brought the demon out her ass too
You done brought the demon out the man, ooh
Demonic, demonic

Kept the fiends comin' back to me, not karma
Smiled at my first kilo like a proud father
Smiled at my first judge like I'll be out tomorrow, keep the Glock on 'em
All eyes on me, I had a Pac moment

Muscle car look like I just got out the bing, whoa

Perfect Strangers by Lil Wayne

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Mmm...

[Chorus]
I don't know who you are anymore
Talkin' to the man in her mirror
That been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit
But, you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care, so who am I to love anyone?
I know it's fucked up
Different city, switchin' women
Puttin' cups up, gettin' fucked up

[Post-Chorus]
And, we don't even talk anymore
Ain't got no time to spare
So who are we to trust anyone?
And that's what's fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's so fucked up

[Verse 1]
Damn, love don't live here
Love, I don't live here
She say, "Why you leave your shit here?"
I'm tryna be sincere
When we both know it ain't right
She hate that we can get loose
But I can never hang tight
But, we don't even make love anymore
Actin' like our phone got our attention
Though we watchin' television, and it's painless
We act like we strangers
I just don't know who we are anymore, damn
I'm not supposed to be here
'Cause love don't live here
But I'm here, and she here
She tell me stay all night
She just want a refill
And then she want to start fights
'Bout "What about how she feel?"
She tell me I'm a cheap thrill
I know she don't mean that
She think I feed her lies
But I don't get no feedback
As she watch me pack
"Baby where my keys at?"
Kiss her on the forehead and tell her that I'll be back
Her teeth smacked

[Chorus]
I don't know who you are anymore
Talkin' to the man in her mirror
That been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit
But you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care
So who am I to love anyone?
I know it's fucked up
Different city, switchin' women, puttin' cups up
Gettin' fucked up

[Post-Chorus]
And, we don't even talk anymore
Ain't got no time to spare
So who are we to trust anyone?
And that's what's fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's so fucked up

[Verse 2]
I was talkin' to myself the other day
My homies call me cray, my mama tell me, "Pray"
She say, "I need a day", I said, "I need a bae"
She said, "Believe in faith
Ma, they love me either way"
Hold up, wait
Let me set my alarm
You say "Don't sweat your alarm"
And now the pressure is on
So now there's sweat in my palm
But her reception ain't warm
So my deception performs
And then that silence is awkward
Like am I deaf or alone?
I got a jet in the morn'
And she upset and I'm calm
And when a woman is scorned
Is when your welcome is worn
And now her temperature's showin'
And I just weather her storm
And she expect me to stay
I be like, "Let go my arm!"
She said...

[Chorus]
I don't know who you are anymore 
Talking to the man in her mirror
I've been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit
And she say, you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care
So who am I to love anyone?
I know it's fucked up
Different city, switchin' women, puttin' cups up
Gettin' fucked up

[Post-Chorus]
She say, we don't even talk anymore
Ain't got no time to spare
So who are we to trust anyone?
And that's what's fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's what's fucked up

[Outro]
She say we don't make love anymore
Actin' like our phone got our attention
Though we watchin' television, now it's painless
We actin' like strangers
Like we don't know who we are anymore
Perfect strangers

ICONIC (ft. Jaden Smith) by Logic

[Intro: Logic]
Shout out to that boy Slim Shady for all the love, yeah!
(Sinatra)

[Chorus: Logic]
Tell me what you know about real life
Tell me what you know about dark nights
Bitch, I'm Bruce Wayne in the game
You just perpetrating from the sideline, what it feel like? (Huh)
Metaphor game too silly
Punch lines way too silly
Fuck a milli', now I'm comin' for that William
Hold up, wait a minute, think about it, that's a billi' (Woo!)

[Verse 1: Logic]
God damn, boy, you know I'm puttin' in the work
I'ma get 'em, I got 'em and now they all hurt
I'ma let 'em know, I never let 'em know
They never seem to know that I am a master (A master at work)
Bitch I'm all up in it, come and get it, you could never get rid of it
Every bit of it in this motherfucker
Like I'm in the middle of little Italy, a lot of shit was never given to me
That's just a fallacy told by the enemy tryna get ahead of me
They dead to me, everybody dead to me
Everybody know that Bobby will body anybody
Like Gotti did Gambino, from Maryland to Reno
We know Tarantino a killer but the Young Sinatra
Got you by the neck and the spirit the second they hear it
They fear it as soon as they get near it, everybody revere it like

[Chorus: Logic]
Tell me-tell me-tell me what you know about real life, real life
Tell me what you know about dark nights, dark nights
Bitch, I'm Bruce Wayne in the game
You just perpetrating from the sideline, what it feel like feel like?
Metaphor game too silly
Punch lines way too silly
Fuck a milli', now I'm comin' for that William
Hold up, wait a minute, think about it, that's a billi'

[Bridge: Logic]
Everybody know that boy Sinatra, he the king now!
Nobody want to step up in the ring now
I sacrificed my twenties now that money ain't a thing now!
Now that money ain't a thing
Everybody know that boy Sinatra, he the king now!
Nobody want to step up in the ring now
I sacrificed my twenties now that money ain't a thing now!
Now that money ain't a thing

[Verse 2: Logic]
Everybody talk about my race on socials
Make the boy wanna go postal
Since I went triple plat'
I only identify as bi-coastal
I don't live life like most do (Like most)
Never did the shit I was supposed to
Not a lotta shit you could say about me
Yeah, my hairline faded but my bank account'll roast you

[Chorus: Logic]
Tell me tell me tell me what you know about real life, real life
Tell me what you know about dark nights, dark nights
Bitch, I'm Bruce Wayne in the game
You just perpetrating from the sideline, what it feel like, feel like?
Metaphor game too silly
Punch lines way too silly
Fuck a milli' now, I'm comin' for that William
Hold up, wait a minute, think about it, that's a billi'

[Interlude: Jaden Smith]
You already know what that is
Young Sinatra, icons inspire icons
Gold chains wrapped around my neck like pythons
The drip way, yeah

[Verse 3: Logic]
Yeah! Greatest alive, I'm the greatest alive
I'm the greatest at being me, ain't nobody seeing me
So, check it like CMB, that's word to the DMV
I'm straight from the basement, I made it like a villain, I'm hated
Word to Jermaine, this shit just ain't been the same
Never simple and plain like a bullet to the brain
I'm blowing minds, yeah, I gotta kick shit with this rhyme
Second I spit it, so divine, that's word to your mom
Sweeping these rappers up like it's a chore, who want more?
I'll leave anybody two times four
Dropping pounds in London like I lost weight
My mindstate is like a freight when I rhyme, check the state of mind
Yeah, my train of thought is never off the track
When I drive it, so stop it I'm killin' 'em like a virus
After they dead I'm still in 'em, who feelin' 'em, everybody now
It's never nothin' like the first time, nothin' like your first rhyme Nothin' like getting that nut in for the first time
That's the type of shit they never tell you now
Bitches come and go, I know, I know, you can't fuck with this flow
Bobby Tarantino, get the C note, oh yeah, there he go
Tell me they love it, they want it, they need it
I never been defeated, no, never given up
Do what I do, how I do gotta live it up
This shit right here on the real, I can't get enough
God damn, uh, I'm the motherfuckin' man
Went from gettin' close to the gang
To sipping champagne on a plane
Do what you love in life and never second guess it
Even when haters protest it now
You ever wonder what it means to
You ever wonder what it, uh
You ever wonder what it means to finally live in your dreams?
Then realize that everything, it just ain't what it seems?
Uh, yeah, I thought I wanted to be the greatest alive
Until I realized that being the greatest is just a lie
Like the opening words in this verse
That as soon as they disperse, make other rappers converse
And plot to put in you a hearse, real talk, fuck rap
I hate and I love it 'cause it's so negative
Everybody selfish, nobody wanna give
A helping hand to the next man, well, fuck you then
Fuck your ethnicity, we all one
'Cause when my last album dropped, you know we all won
Yeah, that shit went number one, so everybody won
I said that shit went number one, so everybody won (Yeah)

Dope New Gospel (feat. Nivea) by Lil Wayne

[Intro]
Man in the mirror,, my hero
He helped me center my ego
When I think I'm bad like Michael
He bring me back down to Tito
Man in the mirror,, my hero
He helped me see like a eagle
He helped me hear enemies cry wolf
Then he see me take off my sheep clothes

[Verse 1]
Hasta la vista, adios
Beat the odds like mosquitoes
Keep in mind I'm a negro
So my open mind got a screen door
Bitches wan' come play the lead role
And end up with nothin' but B-roll
Sit on the dick in a C-4
Then I come back with a cheat code
Pill bottle only half full
But fuck it, my nigga, I'm past good
Sexy bitch rubbin' my tats good
But before she do, bitch, wash yo' hands good
I'm flexin' muscles that you can't pull
You can't make a fist 'cause I'm a handful
I never really knew my dad good
But still grew up to be the big bad wolf
You always see me with the white cup
Some people say that is a bad look
But take a good look at what you are lookin' at
You never know when it's your last look
It's written all over my face
It's tattooed, it can't be erased
One of a kind, I can't be replaced
In case that mirror breaks

[Chorus: Nivea]
Well it's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
Tryna get back right with ya
'Cause I've been on my own
Or at least that's what it feels like
Wanna get back right with ya
It's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like

[Post-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Man in the mirror, my hero
He helped me center my evil
I see the fire in his eyes
But he keep my blood temperature zero
Man in the mirror, my 'migo
Couple a cracks in the mirror
Even through the cracks, I see no cracks in me though

[Verse 2]
Daytime start to turn black
Everything stop like start to twirl
Thank God Weezy back
Order is restored, all is right with the world
Last time become lost time
No free time, 'til I bought time
No tea time, no off time
No me time, on y'all time
Blessings shower from the north side
From the brightest flower out the darkest skies
Love is blind but we caught eyes
It's a bumpy road but a joyride
Still can't ignore my rappetite
Like a hungry shark in a koi pond
Still the motherfuckin' best rapper, a-live
Nigga, y'all died

[Chorus: Nivea]
Well it's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
Tryna get back right with ya
'Cause I've been on my own
Or at least that's what it feels like
Wanna get back right with ya
It's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like
'Cause I've been on my own
Or at least that's what it feels like
Wanna get back right with ya
Yeah It's been way too long
And I wonder what it's been like

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Man in the mirror, my hero
He got me center my ego
When I think I'm bad like Michael
He bring me back down to Tito
It's written all over my face
Tattoos that can't be erased
One of a kind, I can't be replaced
In case that mirror breaks

Wu Tang Forever (ft. Ghostface Killah, Raekwon, RZA, Method Man, Inspectah Deck, Cappadonna, Jackpot Scotty Wotty, U-God, Masta Killa, GZA) by Logic

[Intro background]
En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style
I'd like to try your Wu-Tang style, let's begin, then
Shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu-Tang sword style
If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang could be dangerous
Do you think your Wu-Tang sword can defeat me?
Wu-Tang!
Wu-Tang!
Wu-Tang!
Wu-Tang!

[Verse 1: Logic]
Ayo, ayo, Wu-Tang forever, who rhyme better?
We too clever, the boom bap's back, harder than ever
R.I.P. O.D.B, comin' through like Killa Bee
Ever since I heard Enter the 36 in '93
You cannot defeat my Wu-Tang style, I leave 'em all dismembered
Fuck a mumble rap, that shit won't never be remembered
Not even a contender, no, pretender, best surrender
My agenda is killin' shit, they feelin' this (Sinatra)
Yeah, we live and thorough
Assassinatin' every single muthafuckin' borough
From Staten to Brooklyn to Queens, the Bronx and Harlem
All the way to Maryland, yeah, we comin' for all 'em
Bobby Tarantino to the Digital
My shit is pivotal, smokin' chronic, no medicinal
Who you know assemble the Clan like Voltron?
The one and only Logic, the God, the don, I'm gone

[Break: Ghostface Killah]
Ay-yo, Logic, what up?
We gon' let these muthafuckas try this Wu-Tang style

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, kaboom!
Guess who stepped in the room
It's Ghostface, gold plates, old truths, more cake
Intelligent brothers with nine hoods, movin' snowflakes
Guillotine your head, last scene in the showcase
Push weight, this Colgate, tre-eights and old gates
Exfoliate those we most hate, we don't associate
We wear robes that you can't even pronunciate
We eat foods where you can't even pronounce you ate
Cribs where the floor just rises up and rotates
Locations low-key, can't even locate
Twin nina sisters with the beam, we all soulmates
Team makin' us so much cream, we bought gold plates

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
Yo, mountains of haze in the crib of my blades
It gets messy underneath the dresser, the gauge
57 MB, yo, metallic green, seats is piped off
Seize 'em old tracks, unite through 'em
The kitchen is my palace, get your dance on
While we just levitate with trees, get your branch on
I'm known to wil  out, put the cams on
Jewels down, the sets dip, my gems got grams on
A specialist when I'm bakin'
Rhymes be comin' out, we makin'
We challengin' these chumps for lumps
Here's the statement stop hatin'
The crew is all about gettin' this cake in
You know about me, you relatin'

[Verse 4: RZA]
The enigma, the stigmas that the RZA and the GZA
Both lyrical prolific, fixtures of rap scriptures
Mixtures of hipsters, weed smokers, and beer drinkers
Prince and the Pauper, spiritual clear-thinkers
Cake in the oven, Superbad like McLovin
Huggin' all four boroughs, puffin' herb with my cousin
Academically speaking, rap vocabulary's weakenin'
I felt it comin' like The Weeknd when these starboys start tweakin'
Sporadic pill-poppin' of OxyContin
III-gotten sexual intercourse make shorty wop feel rotten
The travesty-tapestry of microphone mastery has been refuted
Diluted, broken down to a catastrophe
But cats still get the trophy, hit y'all with that "Okie-dokie"
Burt Reynolds, Bandit, goddamnit
Where the fuck is Smokey Bear when you need one?
I got a light-beam gun
I'll blast a hole in your chest that you can't bleed from
But you'll die through iniquity, plus stupidity of that trickery
My verse got it hot up in here, not the humidity
You can never get rid of me, step back and consider me
Wu Killa Bee, but I'm not big on bigotry

[Verse 5: Method Man]
Old school on this track, I feel invincible
This new school ain't really got rules and lack the principles
Got more clowns than the Motown, they puttin' critical
The gun, Smokey Robinson, you need a Miracle
Go back, homie, back when rappers used to be lyrical
When nine out of ten of his friends used to be criminals
The stats, homie, all these killas usin' subliminals
Y'all don't even smile in your pictures, you dudes is miserable
Witty unpredictable torture over your physical
Struggle bar, used to pour water over the cereal
Another bar, reppin' my squad, not individual
But one Nation under God, that's indivisible
My time critical, hands off I'm digital
Me and my Ladybug, back when the planet was Digable
I'm cool like that, my cash rule like that
I'm classic, Patti LaBelle, Voulez Vous like that, come on

[Verse 6: Inspectah Deck]
It's only Logic, we got 'em mobbin' in the mosh pit
Fifth Brother, INS hotter than the tropics
The hot shit I drop quick
Major player, watch my stock lift
Razor-blade sharpness regardless to whom or what
Sound boy, turn that music up
Naysayer, you ain't even got a clue what's up
Deadly melody, the sickness, the remedy
Everything circulate back around eventually
Witty unpredictable, talent all-natural
Gain, Wu-Tang pumpin' through your veins
Twenty-five years, still more of the same
The flow like water with the boilin' flame
INS, your highness, they callin' my name
Boy, I wet the scene similar to fallin' rain
In our own lane, y'all soundin' all the same
Tell 'em Wu-Tang is on your brain

[Verse 7: Cappadonna]
Survival of the fittest be cold days with no money
They don't want me with stacks, they better take it from me
You know the currency gone soon as you break a twenty
So I ain't down if you ain't talkin' that band language
Dear Lord, I'm tryna buy me a train with it
An airplane, see me flyin' to Spain with it
But money don't make me, and I ain't gonna change with it
I'm in the hood, lookin' good, the way I came with it
Do it for the Cs, they understood the game with it
We gave birth when we understood the pain with it
When we create wars, everybody is a gangbanger
We killin' each other, but we all got the same anger
Never go against the grain, homie, that's hateful
Another day in the life for us to be grateful
Spread love, homie, yeah, get a plateful
It's better to stay full, so let's make moves
I know your momma told you that I was a great dude
These dirty-ass cops, they kill and rape you
On some Jason shit, might Crystal in the Lake you
What? What, what? They might Crystal in the Lake you

[Verse 8: Jackpot Scotty Wotty]
Boom bap blast'll blow your sleeves off
Our Flashback Jacks are somethin' to feed off
Smoke and roast ya, the No. 9 Potion
Pull that shit, son, we open the ocean
Who gives a fuck who's snortin' and drinkin' and smokin'?
You get killed for jokin', everybody's hopin'
That's another level of emotion
Food stamps niggas doin' grocery
Police wanna grope me
Perp walk, then nigga street-talk
We bury niggas in sea salt
I carry the torch where I leave off
I'm givin' bitches somethin' to breathe on
I rip off a shoulder to lean on
It's fair game, it's two in a lane, she took two trains
And none of my rhymes are two and the same
Nigga get cooked on a open flame
I'm a hillbilly, Park Hill-trained

[Verse 9: U-God]
My rhyme starts riots in the mountains
Thirty-six million and countin'
The harder they come, the harder I go
Loosen up my arms, can I get comfortable?
Stay on my tip-toes, old-school Wu beat
This is a flip-phone, dude, your slips showin'
Where I come from it stays snowin'
The grammar is raw, I'm slammin' the door
Beez bang bong in your jaw
I hit 'em in the head with the hammer of Thor
Stars and bars, makes me a general
Anything less, makes me a criminal
Gotta dig deep for these Wu-Tang minerals

[Verse 10: Masta Killa]
G.O.D., shadowbox with the L.O.G.I.C
On the count of three, Wu-Tang
First, master your breathin'
I'm mental ass-whoopin', I'm teachin' when I'm speakin'
I'm a champion from Brooklyn
I'm movin' super-ninjas and Shaolin executioners
Avenger, a righteous defender
Grandmaster from the 36th Chamber
Toad style is mentally strong, so strengthen your arms
To hold my microphone you need iron palms
Remain calm, Jamel Irief
Wise chief, Wu-Tang poison clansman from the east, yeah

[Verse 11: GZA]
Enter a world of a universal mind of one kind
A thick swarm of words that's expressed in one rhyme
Food for thought, impossible sliders with the seasoning Regardless, I speak logic clear reasoning
The uncivilized, get the mineral lines, quartz
Self-directed, calculated, controlled thoughts
A point-of-view of the thinkers
Monumental architecture, amazing as the Incas

[Break: Cappadonna]
(Sinatra) (Wu-Tang)
W.T.C., ah-ha
The faculty
Ain't nothin' goin' on, don't nothin' move
Nobody slide, nobody get hurt

[Outro]
En garde, I'll let you try my Wu tang style
I'd like to try your Wu tang style, let's begin, then
Shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu tang sword style
If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu Tang could be dangerous
Do you think your Wu Tang sword can defeat me?

[Intro]
Cover me, oh!

[Chorus]
I can't believe how much I hate
Pressures of a new place roll my way

Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me
I crumble underneath the weight
Pressures of a new place roll my way
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me

But you'll have to tie me down and then break both my hands
If you need anyone
I'll be right there (I'll be right there)
But you'll have to grab my throat and lift me in the air
(If you need anyone)
If you need anyone (If you need anyone)
If you need anyone (If you need anyone)

Oh, jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me, oh!

Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me!
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me!

Nine hundred horse, can you drive that, nigga?
A G5, can you fly that, nigga?

East is up, I'm fearless when I hear this on the low

East is up, when Bishops come together they will know that
Dema don't control us, Dema don't control

What I say when I want to be enough
What a beautiful day for making a break for it
We'll find a way to pay for it
Maybe from all the money we made razorblade stores
Rent a racehorse and force a sponsor
And start a concert, a complete diversion
Start a mob and you can be quite certain
We'll win but not everyone will get out
No, no
We'll win but not everyone will get out
No, no
We'll win but not everyone will get out

Smithereens by Twenty One Pilots

[Verse 1]
You know
I've always been collected, calm and chill
And you know
I never look for conflict for the thrill
But if I m feeling
Someone stepping towards you, can't describe
Just what I'm feeling

[Chorus]
For you, I d go
Step to a dude much bigger than me
For you, I know
I would get messed up, weigh 153
For you
I would get beat to smithereens

[Verse 2]
You know
I'll be in the corner taking notes
And you know
I got your six while you're working votes
But if I'm feeling
Someone stepping towards you, can't describe
Just what I'm feeling

[Chorus]
For you, I'd go
Step to a dude much bigger than me
For you, I know
I would get messed up, weigh 153
For you
I would get beat to smithereens

[Bridge]
(Fight fight fight fight fight)
(I would get beat to)
You know I had to do one
You know I had to do one
You know I had to do one on the record (For you)
You know I had to do one on the record for her like this
You know I had to do one on the record for her like this
You know I had to do one on the record for her like this
You know I had to do one on the record for her

[Refrain]
If I'm feeling
Someone stepping towards you, can t describe
Just what I m feeling

[Outro]
For you, I'd go
Write a slick song just to show you the world
For you, I know
They think it s messed up to sell out for your girl
For you, I'd go
Step to a dude much bigger than me
For you, I know
I would get messed up, weigh 153
For you
I would get beat to smithereens

Neon Gravestones by Twenty One Pilots

[Intro]
Call (Call)
Call (Call)
Call (Call)

[Verse 1]
What's my problem?
Well, I want you to follow me down to the bottom
Underneath the insane asylum
Keep your wits about you while you got 'em
'Cause your wits are first to go while you're problem-solvin'
And my problem?
We glorify those even more when they...
My opinion, our culture can treat a loss like it's a win
And right before we turn on them
We give 'em the highest of praise
And hang their banner from the ceiling
Communicating, further engraving
An earlier grave is an optional way, no

[Chorus]
Neon gravestones try to call (Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones (Neon gravestones try to call)
Call (For my bones)
Call, call, call (Call, call, call)
Call (Call)
Call (Call)

[Verse 2]
What's my problem?
Don't get it twisted
It's with the people we praise who may have assisted
I could use the streams and extra conversations
I could give up, and boost up my reputation
I could go out with a bang
They would know my name
They would host and post a celebration
My opinion will not be lenient
My opinion, it's real convenient
Our words are loud, but now I'm talking action
We don't get enough love?
Well, they get a fraction
They say, "How could he go if he's got everything?
I'll mourn for a kid, but won't cry for a king"

[Chorus]
Neon gravestones try to call (Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones (Neon gravestones try to call)
Call (For my bones)
Call, call, call

[Bridge 1]
Promise me this (Call, call)
If I lose to myself
You won't mourn a day
And you'll move onto someone else
Promise me this
If I lose to myself
You won't mourn a day
And you'll move onto someone else
(Ooh, call, ooh, call)

[Chorus]
Neon gravestones try to call
(Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones
(Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call
(Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones
(Neon gravestones try to call for my bones)

[Bridge 2]
'Cause they won't get them
No, they won't get them
They won't get them
But they won't get them

[Verse 3]
Don't get me wrong, the rise in awareness
Is beating a stigma that no longer scares us
But for sake of discussion, in spirit of fairness
Could we give this some room for a new point of view?
And could it be true that some could be tempted
To use this mistake as a form of aggression?
A form of succession?
A form of a weapon?
Thinking "I'll teach them"
Well, I'm refusing the lesson
It won't resonate in our minds
I'm not disrespecting what was left behind
Just pleading that it does not get glorified
Maybe we swap out what it is that we hold so high
Find your grandparents or someone of age
Pay some respects for the path that they paved
To life, they were dedicated
Now, that should be celebrated

The Hype by Twenty One Pilots

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel cold, even paralyzed
My interior world needs to sanitize
I've got to step through or I ll dissipate
I'll record my step through for my basement tapes

[Chorus]
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you re a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype

[Verse 2]
Yeah, they might be talking behind your head
Your exterior world can step off instead
It might take some friends and a warmer shirt
But you don't get thick skin without getting burnt

[Chorus]
Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype
(Take me with you)

[Bridge]
(We re gonna rely pretty heavily
On technology
And energy
To cover up the fact that we re only two people
But I think we can do it)

No, I don't know which way I m going
But I can hear my way around
No, I don't know which way I'm going
But I can hear my way around
No, I don't know which way I m going
But I can hear my way around
No, I don't know which way I'm going
But I can hear my way around
But I can hear my way around

Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine

Levitate by Twenty One Pilots

[Chorus]
Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet
And ever since the seventh grade I learned to fire-breathe
And though I feed on things that fell
You can learn to levitate with just a little help
Learn to levitate with just a little help

[Bridge]
Come down, come down
Cowards only come through when the hour's late
And everyone's asleep, mind you
Now show up, show up
I know I shouldn't say this
But a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man
Come down, come down
Cowards only come through when the hour's late
And everyone's asleep, mind you
Now show up, show up
I know I shouldn't say this
But a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man

[Verse]
Danger in the fabric of this thing I made
I probably shouldn't show you, but it's way too late
My heart is with you hiding, but my mind's not made
Now they know it like we both knew for some time I'd say
They're smirking at fresh blood, they're circling above
But this is not enough, yeah, this is not what you thought
No, no, we are not just graffiti on a passing train
I got back what I once bought back
In that slot, I won't need to replace
This culture is a poacher of overexposure, not today
Don't feed me to the vultures, I am a vulture who feeds on pain
Sleep in a well-lit room, don't let the shadow through
And sever all I knew, yeah, sever all
I thought I could depend on my weekends
On the freezing ground that I'm sleeping on
Please, keep me from, please keep me down from the ledges
Better test it, wooden wedges under doorways
Keep your wooden wedges under doors
Chorus, verse, chorus, verse, now here comes the eight
Wait, habits here too, you re the worst, your structure compensates
But compensation feels a lot like rising up to dominate by track two
At least they all know all they hear comes from a place

[Chorus]
Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet
And ever since the seventh grade I learned to fire-breathe
And though I feed on things that fell
You can learn to levitate with just a little help
You can levitate with just a little help

[Outro]
Welcome to Trench

Bandito by Twenty One Pilots

[Chorus]
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a ban I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a ban I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a ban I'm a bandito

[Verse 1]
This is the sound we make
When in between two places
Where we used to bleed
And where our blood needs to be

[Chorus]
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a ban I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a ban I'm a bandito

[Verse 2]
In City, I feel my spirit is contained
Like neon inside the glass, they form my brain
But I recently discovered it's a heatless fire
Like nicknames they give themselves to uninspire
Begin with bullet, now add fire to the proof
But I'm still not sure if fear's a rival or close relative to truth
Either way it helps to hear these words bounce off of you
The softest echo could be enough for me to make it through

[Bridge]
Folina, Sahlo Folina
Sahlo Folina, Sahlo Folina
I created this world to feel some control
Destroy it if I want
So I sing Sahlo Folina, Sahlo Folina, Sahlo

[Chorus]
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low (Sahlo)
I'm a ban I'm a bandito
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low
I'm a ban I'm a bandito (Sahlo)
I could take the high road
But I know that I'm goin' low (Sahlo)
I'm a ban I'm a bandito

[Outro]
I created this world to feel some control
Destroy it if I want
So I sing Sahlo Folina, Sahlo Folina

If you decide all is well (All is well)

Pet Cheetah by Twenty One Pilots

[Verse 1]
I am on an island, no one to confide
Eight days straight, eight hours each and not one line
I can feel pressure start to possess my mind
So, I'll take this beat I should delete to exercise

[Chorus]
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem

[Verse 2]
I've got a pet cheetah down in my basement
I've raised him, and bathed him, and named him Jason
Statham, I've trained him to make me these beats
Now my pet cheetah's quicker in the studio than on his feet
I'ma get mine and get going
I'm showing my faces in just enough places
I'm done with tip-toeing, I'll stay in my room
My house is the one where the vultures are perched on the roof
Get behind me, I bet this nepotistic mindset
Will help us get ours as we're growing
This clique means so much to this dude
It could make him afraid of his music
And be scared to death he could lose it

[Chorus]
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem

[Interlude]
I'll sit here 'til I
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem, no
I'll sit here 'til I
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem

[Chorus]
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem
No, I move slow
I want to stop time
I'll sit here 'til I find the problem

[Bridge]
I can feel pressure start to possess my mind
So I'll take this beat I should delete to exercise

[Intro: Gunna]
Yeah, yah
Uh

Yeah

[Chorus: Gunna]
I tote a TEC 'cause niggas be shady
And a surfboard 'cause we're really wavy
I need some love to go with this hate
Give mama a hug, we finally made it
We puttin' Ms in all the Mercedes
Spend a whole M in the mall, boy you crazy
Bitches ain't shit, bet' not trust your old lady
Business is business, so you gotta pay me

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Uh, Bentleys on Bentleys, we mob through the A
Benjis on Benjis, we stack every day
Business is business, so you gotta pay
New Lamborghinis make me wanna race
Still eat fettuccine I'm stuck in my ways
My bed Tempur-Pedic, I fuckin' get paid
My flow a disease, kill these rappers like AIDS
Yves St. Laurent on the lens of my shades
Gunna back up, I was goin' through a phase
I doubled up and got my bitches straight
You learned how to drip from you watchin' my page
Niggas be tossin', somebody decay
Off-White'd the coupe and the inside is beige
I pop this shit like I've been doin' for ages
So many dead faces I got me a grave
YSL, nigga say "Slatt" every day
I pop me a pill, one got stuck in my throat
This Rollie a Presi', I don't need to vote
Your ho super ready, she at my condo
I stay with that 9, they should call me Marlo
I'm the greatest of all, my emoji is goat
Bouncin' my life, got my back off the rope
Too real I can't turn my back on the bros

[Chorus: Gunna]
I tote a TEC 'cause niggas be shady
And a surfboard 'cause we're really wavy
I need some love to go with this hate
Give mama a hug, we finally made it

Spend a whole M in the mall, boy you crazy
Bitches ain't shit, bet' not trust your old lady
Business is business, so you gotta pay me

[Verse 2: Lil Baby & (Gunna)]
Brought out a dub and I'm ready to spend it
You dropped the ball I got it, we winnin'
Spaceship for a car that ain't rented
They know who I am, I ain't walkin' through Lenox
It didn't take long, I ran up them racks
Bought it, ain't like it, ain't takin it back
I shoulda playin' linebacker, I want a sack
I got this cheetah print all on my jacket
I got the belt and the shoes to match it
I'm from the hood, I'm keepin' my ratchet
My bitch the baddest, she ain't bougie, she ratchet
I get him flipped, then I buy him a casket
I'm servin' real, I ain't just singin', rappin'
I got on Soldier Re's, they're classics
I got a 31 doin' gymnastics
I sold a brick, it was still in the package
Sixty five hundred was spent on this coat
(Got a bitch in the condo, she snortin' the coke)
I don't wanna fuck her just want the throat
I'm savin' my money, I ain't goin' broke
Don't want no handouts, that shit ain't no joke
They listen up when I speak, I'm the pope
I'm bringin' cash, ain't payin' no notes
I got the stick just in case they want smoke

[Chorus: Gunna]
I tote a TEC 'cause niggas be shady
And a surfboard 'cause we're really wavy (Surfboard)
I need some love to go with this hate
Give mama a hug, we finally made it (Finally made it)
Puttin' Ms in all the Mercedes
Spend a whole M in the mall, boy you crazy
Bitches ain't shit, bet' not trust your old lady (Bitches ain't shit)
Business is business, so you gotta pay me (Business is business)

Always Remember Us This Way by Lady Gaga

[Verse 1]
That Arizona sky
Burnin' in your eyes
You look at me and babe, I wanna catch on fire
It s buried in my soul
Like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn t find

[Chorus]
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

[Verse 2]
Lovers in the night
Poets tryna write
We don't know how to rhyme, but damn, we try
But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die

[Chorus]
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

[Bridge]
Oh yeah
I don't wanna be just a memory, baby, yeah
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo hoo hooooooooo

[Chorus]
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down and the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way
Way yeah

[Outro]
When you look at me and the whole world fades
I'll always remember us this way

Vertigo by Khalid

[Verse 1]
Are we better off believing
What the ignorance suggests?
I wish living life was easy (Mhm)
But mine has been a mess
They say it comes with the seasons (Mhm)
But the seasons come and go (They go)
I go blurry when I'm thinking
Is it me or vertigo?

[Pre-Chorus]
Criticized, who am I to give up?
I m breathing, what's the reason to let up?
Sympathize, who am I to give up?
Putting on my favorite get up

[Chorus]
Are we alive?
Or are we dreaming?
After the ride
Are you leaving?
Are we alive? (Darker days, brighter endings)
Or are we dreaming? (Darker days, brighter endings)
After the ride
Are you leaving? (Darker days, brighter endings)
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I've been better off than broken
I ve been battered, I've been beat
I wish I was more outspoken
But the words are out of reach
Hmm, thought I loved you in the moment
I was happy, I was young
I've been learning, I've been growing
But the worst is yet to come

[Pre-Chorus]
Criticized, who am I to give up? (Who am I?)
I'm breathing, what's the reason to let up?
Sympathize, who am I to give up?
Putting on my favorite get up

[Chorus]
Are we alive?
Or are we dreaming?
After the ride
Are you leaving?
Are we alive? (Darker days, brighter endings)
Or are we dreaming? (Darker days, brighter endings)
After the ride
Are you leaving? (Darker days, brighter endings)
Yeah

Motion by Khalid

[Verse 1]
You'd rather speak more than listen
And that's based off our first impression
I'm new to all this affection
But I'm going in the right direction
Floating through different dimensions
But not losing sense of religion
Honey, I forgot to mention
I'm so entranced by you, it hurts

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the moment
See me floatin', see me glowin'
I'm in love with the moment
See me floatin', see me glowin'

[Verse 2]
Can't let me go if I'm fallin'
I've been on the path of importance
Let the love pull you in slowly
The river is running, we're flowing
I'm coming down, you've been rollin'
And we're letting free, now we're open
Pour me a, pour me a potion
I'm rocking, I'm rocking the motion

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the moment
See me floatin', see me glowin'
I'm in love with the moment
See me floatin', see me glowin'

I'm alone in my house
I'm out on the town
I'm at the bottom of the bottle

I can't get back up on my feet
See the lights on the street like stars

But look what I found
Look what I found
Another piece of my heart
Just layin' on the ground

Under the foggy day

But look what I found
Somebody who loves me

Somebody who'll carry 'round a piece of my heart
Just layin' on the ground

Heart all over the floor

I got on wings like a Bentley, I feel way too high
Left the sticker on the window still got the paper tag
Louis Vuitton bandana, too many shopping bags
Richard Mille or the Rollie, it don't tick tock
Hermes bandana just like 2Pac
My little brother, he a scammer, ride with 2 choppas
We want ecstasy and codeine, we don't detox

Codeine in my cup, money on my mind
Gonna take this Percocet and try and see stars
Presently, they askin' young niggas I got bars
Hope you never get to murder solvin' like nothin' wrong
Hope, the day you run into your ops, you get 'em goin'
I be with my Chi town brothers, Al Capone
Me and Juice killin these niggas like they got they hands down
Blood in my eyes, blood on my hands
Blood in my cup, blood on my bands
Made a million dollars in abandoned buildings
Drinkin' out the bottle, you abandon my feelings
I took three 10s and went hasta luego
Juice WRLD prolly in that 'Rari actin' a a-hole

Gang comin' strong, yeah we rollin' out
Throw a party like Rollin' Loud
Ayy, don't come unless she stay in focus
Soldiers at 10-4, sent your bitch the info
Feelin' real blessed with Juice, that's my kinfolk
Bless up, she tell me I'm a god, get on her knees for confession
Sent a vid to her nigga, had to teach a lesson
Me and Boat only want bad hoes in our section
Juice, why these pussy ass niggas always pressin'?
I don't know, let 'em talk, I'ma go get my Smith & Wesson
Blessed boys under 21, steady flexin'
I'm gettin' too rich, can't do flights with connections
.40 on my hip, I won't fight, bitch I'm reckless
Codeine what I sip, that shit come in straight from Texas
Reach for my chain, you'll get beat just like Nexus
Lamborghini dreams, but you still drive a Lexus
I'm a young king, I might fuck Alexis Texas
But I ain't on no Drake shit, I won't get her pregnant
Damn, young Juice WRLD, boy, you reckless
And I feel you, until I get her naked
When I get up in it, I might have to stay in
Well if she goin' like that, let's run a train then
Fuck, I think I nutted in her, I might need a playpen
And a stroller
How I get this deep? We rode her like a Rover
No games, but I XBOX control her
She do the gang like a nerd doin' homework
.40 in my pants, that bitch thought it was a boner
If I go broke, I'ma juug off Motorolas
But now I'm up in France, Lil Boat, that's my mans
We get the green and then we fly around like Peter Pan
That's cool, but I just thought 'bout somethin', wait
(What?)
This baby got your face
So fuck that lil' baby, boy's back to the place
Back to the trap, back to the gang

[Chorus: Juice WRLD & Lil Yachty]

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Lotta money talk, it's hard to understand me (Understand me)
Big bank, so I moved it to Miami (To Miami)

Tryna make these pussy niggas understand me (Understand me)
Lotta money talk, it's hard to understand me (Understand me)

Couple rings I was hustlin'
Through the rain and the storm (Yeah)
Through the hunger and the jungle
I'ma slide on a nigga

In the court, I been missin' court, yeah (Court, yeah)

I can't believe some of my niggas double-crossed me
Shit is hard and I'm broken, but I cope
I fit a 35 in the backwood when I smoke
And niggas askin' why I smoke so many blunts, huh?
Because these backwoods and these blunts are full of numb, huh
And all this Actavis and drank, it make me numb, huh
The only time when I feel at peace is when I'm dumb high
I keep the flashy Jesus pieces when I stunt now
I keep a quarter-million pieces when I stunt now
Them dumb ass teachers and police said I'd be nothin', huh?
I ducked the Priest and chased my dreams and now his son's hot
That Wraith ain't rented, when I pull up man it's sun hot
I'm movin' geetchie with bitches, they be out buggin' now
Talkin' with opinions, all they got is opinions
I'm back and forth in millions, all y'all pussy niggas my minions
I spend days in Givenchy, Mama told me I would get it
I kept a .30 on me long and it had the extension
These niggas did me dirty, no I can't speak on friendship
I can't speak on this tension, spent most the year suspended
Bitch, I came from the bottom, finna head to the tippy
One thing a nigga noticed, I gotta get it, that's why it's a

Oh, I done made myself a livin'
I been dodgin' the sentence
I asked God for forgiveness
Then I put rose gold on the tennis
I told 'em put a hold on the hearing
It's a 58 on the engine
Feel like I'm in a race for these millions
Put it in the safe for the business
Walk with a hundred K in the denim
I know why he got hate in his feelings
These niggas want the wave I invented
I'm gonna cop a Wraith and a Bentley
Dolce and Gabana, Gunna drippin'
Plus I'm getting this money independent
Top off in the summer 'cause we winnin'
Windows up and we breezy
VVS from Elliante and my pearls came from CC
Bal Harbour shopping spree anytime I'm in Miami
Hope to see my people face when I make it to the Grammys
Park the Yacht next to the dock and we hoppin' on a Jetski
Bought the racks for my Rollie watch, see me shinin' from the nosebleeds
Pour the syrup in my soda pop, I hope I never OD
They steal the drip when my pictures drop, they lookin' like the old me
And I bought a jacket, M.I.A, I'm with my dog
I painted a picture, you can frame it on a wall, yeah
I made her my bitch and painted the insides of her walls, yeah
Got a bank account and fill it with M's so we can ball

I'm a motherfuckin' starboy

[Verse 2]
Every day a nigga try to test me, ah
Every day a nigga try to end me, ah
Pull off in that Roadster SV, ah
Pockets overweight, gettin' hefty, ah
Coming for the king, that's a far cry, ah
I come alive in the fall time, I
No competition, I don't really listen
I m in the blue Mulsanne bumping New Edition

[Pre-Chorus]
House so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking bout me, I don t see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

[Chorus]
Look what you've done
I m a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin  starboy

[Verse 3]
Let a nigga brag Pitt
Legend of the fall took the year like a bandit
Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
100 on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars

[Pre-Chorus]
House so empty, need a centerpiece
20 racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

[Chorus]
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Yeah, hit the lights, yeah hit a right (Lights)
Took everything, ain't nothing left (Ain't left)

All week we ball but we don't mesh (Ball)
All week we drink, leave us a mess (Drinking)

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
Oh, oh

No More (feat. Travis Scott, Kodak Black & 21 Savage) by Metro Boomin

[Intro: Travis Scott]
You know the comedown, we really feeling soothing
The come-up got 'em all oozing
Took a one way to take it out of Houston
Took the Metro and we was still boomin'

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I just pour 'til I can't pour no more
I slow down but it ain't slow no more
I stack up 'cause it don't fold no more
I pour up 'til I can't pour no more
I slow down but it ain't slow no more
I stack up 'cause it don't fold no more

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Nowadays, I be on ecstasy when I'm bored
I don't even know who keep it real anymore
All that living fast, pour the lean, make me slower
You know I ain't that nigga to be played, do your homework
If I could do it all over, I'd make the same mistakes
All that fucking over made me who I am today
Slidin' Maybach with the drapes, you can't see me pass
I was in the school on a C class
I tried the Perky but it ain't work, and I'ma still pop 'em
Drinking purple, smokin' purp, I need to see about it
All that pain, I'm poppin' molly like an antibiotic
I can't help it, I'm a zombie, I can't heal my heartache

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I pop pills 'til I can't feel no more
Tryna be sane but I can't hold no more
I wanted fame but I don't know no more
I pop pills 'til I can't feel no more
Tryna be sane but I can't hold no more
I wanted fame but I don't know no more

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Tried love but I can't no more (Nah)
Tryna find loyalty, it ain't no more (Nah)
Told myself I wasn't gonna drink no more (On God)
It's like the styrofoam glued to me though (Straight up)
I feel weak for using drugs to ease the pain (21)
From the street, concrete in my vein (Straight up)
Lil bit of change make a nigga change (On God)
Different tax bracket but my number still the same (Facts)
I done seen dope turn a nigga who had hope
To a nigga with no hope, hung himself by a rope (Straight up)
No joke 'cause he didn't know the ropes
And he served an undercover, judge gave his ass a boat (Facts)
I done seen fame turn a nigga on his bro
Turn a bitch into a nigga, nigga turned into a ho (21)
Identity crisis, people don't know who they is
'Cause these bitches act like niggas
And these niggas act like hoes (Straight up)
Shooting for the moon but the stars just fine (21)
Tryna make a dollar and I'm short nine dimes (21)
You know I'm a hustler, I'ma grind 'bout mine (21)
Long as I got Metro, nigga I'm gon' shine

[Chorus: 21 Savage, Travis Scott, & Kodak Black]
I sip drank until I can't no more
Pour up the lean until I can't no more
One more cup, I think I just might snore
I sip drank until I can't no more
Pour up the lean until I can't no more
One more cup, I think I just might snore
I just pour 'til I can't pour no more
I slow down but it ain't slow no more
I stack up 'cause it don't fold no more
I pop pills 'til I can't feel no more
Tryna be sane but I can't hold no more
I wanted fame but I don't know no more

[Outro]
(Lord, save the world
Lord, save the world
Lord, save the world)
Lord, save the world (Lord, save the world)
Lord, save the world (Lord, save the world)
From this hunger for power (Lord, save the world)
From certain destruction's hour
Motherfuckers cannot listen to that fuckin' save the world shit
No, I don't like it
We are totally against that shit
You stream it, iPhone or your phone, whatever
I'm taking the shit and I'm here to tell you
I'm here to keep rap the fucking same
He's trying to save it, I'm not
You'll all be heroes

Dreamcatcher (feat. Swae Lee & Travis Scott) by Metro Boomin

[Intro]
When you come back in here, we gon' be like, ayy!
Trust me, bitch, trust me

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Hypnotize me with that motion
Girl, you might even provoke me
To spend, spend all I've got
I can get it back real quick
Give you an experience
Like you've never had before
Dreamcatcher on your thigh, yeah
How'd you get so fine, babe?
I can make you go night, night
I can make you go night, night
You be down for whatever
When I pour it up, I don't measure (Hey)
Say you love me five-ever
All of a sudden
Make this bitch jump like a step team
See my diamonds, can you say, "Wet dream"?
First, let me close the bamboo blinds
She don't say my name but she gonna scream it

[Refrain: Swae Lee]
Dancin' in the strobe lights
With your eyes on me
I don't need to know your sign
Do you see somethin' you like?

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I know what you're into
I know what you're into
I know what you're into

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Hey, yeah!
I can't take your call, I need FaceTime
Rode the metro, took the bassline
Took all the good stuff, now it ain't mine (Hey)
You've been gone for forever
How much I miss your love, I can't measure (No)
Know you got it, nothin' special
But just for this night, go up a level (Hey)
When we pop outside, let you take lead (Lead)
She just treat the dick like a jetski (Skeet, skeet)
Models posted up like a set piece (Piece)
Where you get these from? I can't take these (Down, yeah)
I'm the one, number one
I've done finally found my home between the moon and the sun
Every time we come around, just know it move and it run
Man it's crazy, all my youngins gotta move with a gun
Drop it down, drop it down, way you do it
Know you come from out of town
I've been stuck off in my ways, I've been workin' on it
On some on my own time, don't be waitin' on me
I've been zoned out in the days, it's a head burst
I've been livin' through a maze on my Fred Durst
Get that shit from out my way, make the mess worse
To the A.M., I make my rounds
Not a peep, don't hear a sound
Now you know if you ain't know it, now you know

[Chorus: Swae Lee & Travis Scott]
I know what you're into
I know what you're into
I know what you're into
Into, I know what you're into
I know what you're into
I know what you're into
Into, I know what you're into
I know what you're into
I know what you're into (Hey)

[Refrain: Swae Lee]
Dancin' in the strobe lights
With your eyes on me
I don't need to know your sign
Do you see somethin' you like?

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I know what you're into
I know what you're into
I know what you're into

[Chorus]
Woke up this morning, can't remember nothing
Two bitches just flew in from London (Two bitches)
Last thing I remember they callin' me daddy
The mattress was covered in money (In hunnids)
Went to sleep with my jewelry and chains on
Had to wake up and recount the money (Recount it)
I got a bitch, she gon' kill for real, talk about Clyde and Bonnie (Brr)

[Post-Chorus]
Coupe with the kit, cop it (Got to)
Pull up with a stick, stop it (Stop it)
Rich nigga shit, solid (Rich nigga)
Old hunnids, pockets rotted (Cottage)
I go to space with the stars (Stars)
Might smoke a blunt with my pilot (Cookie)
Saturn, Moon, Earth, and Mars (Mars)
NASA takeoff with the rocket (NASA)

Half a million on a necklace (A half)
Young rich niggas we successful (Successful)

That coco make her feel special (Coco)
I count a hunnid or better (One hunnid)
Back end two hunnid or better (Two hunnid)
I might go put all my chains on (Ice)
I just might change up the weather (Change it)
She pop a perc, her pussy wetter (Drip)
I met the bitch at Coachella (Coachella)
If she nutella she'd probably do better
But can I get a E for effort? (E)
I prayed to God to wash my sins (God)
Nothing formed against me, not a weapon (No weapon)
Ask Him where do I begin (Where?)
Devil tryna take my blessings (My blessings)
They don't know the meaning of the white (Naw)
You don't really live this life (No)
Niggas in the hood shootin' twice (Pew pew)
See my niggas in the hood shoot precise (Brr)
Real wise, we ain't taking no advice (Naw)
I realize that these hoes ain't right (All of 'em)
Don't even ask, 'cause they know what's the price (Price)
Ain't gotta snow, they already know it's white (White)
I talk to God cause I been baptized (Baptized)
I got mob ties to the nawf side (Nawf side)
Pull up with the sticks on the niggas, straight slime (Skrt-Skrt)
They gon' make the nawf side high crime (Nawf)
Better not hit a lick with these niggas droppin' ten (Huh)
Hit a lick with these niggas droppin' dimes
Fuckin' on her friend I'ma break her back in (Smash)
Lookin' at the watch I can't waste time (T-T-Takeoff)

All my life been sittin' at the table
Watchin' them kids, they're living in a fable
Looks, luck, money and never left a'wishin'
But now it's 'bout time to raise up and petition
All my life been sittin' at the table
Watching them kids, they're living in a fable

And I'm not scared of the beast in the belly
Fill my cup with endless ambition
And paint this town with my very own vision

Not a part of your machine

Borrowed Love (feat. Swae Lee & WizKid) by Metro Boomin

[Intro: Swae Lee]
After laughter comes tears
After laughter comes tears
It's just hope, you gon' end up feelin' sorrow

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Melatonin, baby, take it this time
We don't wanna end up hurtin' tomorrow
Long term or temporary, I can't decide
How much of my love can you borrow?
Tighten up, baby, yes I fell for you almost
Tried my best to build you up from the bottom

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
She wetter than a river
Body say so much, she got me off the bottle
I'm finally freed up
She freaky as fuck, I leave, she gon' follow
She gave me a sign
My fingers on her panty line
Rollin' up a dandelion
Took a sec' just to catch the vibe
Second guessin', that's something I never wanna do
Crack under pressure, that's something I'm never gonna do

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Melatonin, baby, take it this time
We don't wanna end up hurtin' tomorrow
Long term or temporary, I can't decide
How much of my love can you borrow?
Tighten up, baby, yes I fell for you almost
Tried my best to build you up from the bottom

[Verse 2: Wizkid]
Baby girl, just turn off the light, turn off the light
Baby, show me love, baby, turn off the light
Baby, ease my stress, baby, turn off the light
Baby, back it up, don't turn up the fight
Turn off the light, my girl, say you're fine
I need that energy, I need that energy tonight
Gyal, keep it cold and bun up the vibe
Say, me no gon' live tonight, girl turn up the vibe
Say, me no gwaan fight every day
Love it when we play, love it when we, yeah, yeah
Say, me wan' vibe on replay
Leave me dumb crazy, love me, baby, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Melatonin, baby, take it this time
We don't wanna end up hurtin' tomorrow
Long term or temporary, I can't decide
How much of my love can you borrow?
Tighten up, baby, yes I fell for you almost
Tried my best to build you up from the bottom

[Outro: Swae Lee]
I'm callin' it quits
Leave that for my ex
We flipped the whole script
I couldn't even risk it
I don't give hints
Goodbye, she was gone by six
I couldn't read lips
It's hard when I'm twisted

Life is Beautiful by Lil Peep

[Verse 1]
I know that it hurts sometimes, but it's beautiful
Working every day, now you're bleeding through your cuticles
Passing through a portal as you're sittin' in your cubicle
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Tryin' to keep your cool at your grandfather's funeral
Finding out eventually the feeling wasn't mutual
You were not invited 'cause you're nothing like the usual
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
You wanna see your friends, but you're stuck inside a hospital
Doctor walks in and he tells you that it's terminal
Tumor in your brain and they're sayin' it's inoperable
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
They'll kill your little brother and they'll tell you he's a criminal
They'll fucking kill you too, so you better not get physical
Welcome to America, the type of shit is typical
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful

[Verse 2]
Wake up in the morning, now you doing the impossible
Find out what's important, now you're feeling philosophical
When I die, I'll pack my bags, move somewhere more affordable
Isn't life horrible? I think that life is horrible
You think she's adorable, she thinks that you're intolerable
You think you can do it, but your chances are improbable
Once you feel unstoppable, you run into an obstacle
Isn't life comical? I think that life is comical

[Verse 3]
And if you ever need a friend then you got me
And in the end, when I die, would you watch me?
And if I try suicide, would you stop me?
Would you help me get a grip or would you drop me?
Run away, make friends with the moon
Why you trippin'? You'll be with your friends soon
There comes a time when everybody meets the same fate
I think I'ma die alone inside my room

[Outro]
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful

Radio Ga Ga - Live Aid by Queen

[Verse 1]
I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds, invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

[Pre-Chorus]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

[Chorus]
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio, blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you

[Verse 2]
We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years
Let's hope you never leave, old friend
Like all good things, on you, we depend
So, stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

[Pre-Chorus]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio

[Chorus]
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga

Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you

No, no, no, no, no love
Oh, I only want you

[Verse 1]
I don't want another night of tryna find
Another you, another rock bottom
I don't wanna wear another mini dress
To impress a potential problem
I don't wanna spend the night at someone's place
To fill the space that you used to walk in
I don't want another number in my phone
Someone to hold at three in the morning

I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you, yeah

[Verse 2]
I know I'm the one who ruined everything
And made you think that it was all your fault
And I know that sorry's only just a word
And when it hurts, it isn't that simple
But I know that if you look me in the eyes
You can't deny that we're something different
And I know I'm going looking for your kiss
On someone's lips to know that I miss ya

Lord, what you're doing to me
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord

[Chorus]
Somebody (Somebody)
Ooh, somebody (Somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I work hard (He works hard)
Every day of my life
I work 'til I ache my bones
At the end (At the end of the day)
I take home my hard-earned pay all on my own
(Goes home, goes home on his own)
I get down (Down) on my knees (Knees)
And I start to pray (Praise the Lord)
'Til the tears run down from my eyes, Lord

[Chorus]
Somebody (Somebody)
Ooh, somebody (Please)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

[Bridge]
(He works hard)
Everyday (Everyday)
I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
No, I got no common sense
(He's got) Got nobody left to believe
(No, no, no, no)

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
(Ooh, Lord)
Ooh, somebody
Ooh (Somebody)
Anybody find me somebody to love?
(Can anybody find me someone to love?)

[Verse 3]
Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat (Just keep losing and losing)
I'm okay, I'm alright (He's alright, he's alright)
I ain't gonna face no defeat (Yeah, yeah)
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord

[Outro]
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love

Somebody find me, find me somebody to love

Anybody, anywhere, anybody find me somebody to love
Find me, find me, find me

Drippin' like I just took a shit and clogged toilet
Captain Long John Silver, I'm gonna reel 'em in
Got on goat fur cream color coat from Burberry's Den
I'm a monster with a nice watch on, name not Ben 10
I'ma go get everything Mother Earth transcends

[Chorus]

Three bitches three different colors, Powerpuff girls, sir

Hol' up I just pull up in a new Mercedes

What's Free (feat. Rick Ross & Jay Z) by Meek Mill

[Intro: Meek Mill]
You know what free is, nigga?

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
What's free?
Free is when nobody else could tell us what to be
Free is when the TV ain't controllin' what we see
Told my niggas, "I need you"
Through all the fame, you know I stayed true
Pray my niggas stay free
Made a few mistakes but this ain't where I wanna be
Before I'm judged by 12, put a 12 on my V
Told my niggas, "I need you"
Stay up, I know these times ain't true
Real life, what's free?

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Since a lad, I was cunning, just got a pad out in London
I keep stackin' my money, I'll need a ladder by summer
AK shots, niggas duckin' stray shots
Been a top dog, that's before the K-Dots
Crackin' in '06, immaculate showmanship
Talkin' like you Mitch, disastrous on the strip
Holdin' on your bitch, coulda never sold you a brick
With them people, you never been on a list
Mona Lisa to me ain't nothin' but a bitch
Hangin' pictures like niggas swingin' from his dick
We so different, you thought these didn't exist (M-M)
The Megalodon never seen on his wrist
I'm from the South where they never make it this rich
God is the greatest, but Satan been on his shit
Walkin' the pavement, I pray I'm illuminated
Over a decade and never nobody's favorite
Pot and kilo go hand in hand like we Gamble and Huff
My amigo, a million grams and we countin' 'em up (M-M)
You was dead broke, I let you hold a pack
You paid for it, but I fucked around and stole the track
Screaming "gang gang," now you wanna rat
Racketeering charges caught him on a tap
Lookin' for a bond, lawyers wanna tax
Purple hair got them faggots on your back
(M-M-Maybach music)

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
What's free?
Free is when nobody else could tell us what to be
Free is when the TV ain't controllin' what we see
Told my niggas, "I need you"
Through all the fame, you know I stayed true
Pray my niggas stay free
Made a few mistakes but this ain't where I wanna be
Before I'm judged by 12, put a 12 on my V
Told my niggas, "I need you"
Stay up, I know these times ain't true
Real life, what's free? (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Fed investigations, heard they plottin' like I trap
20 mill' in cash, they know I got that off of rap
Maybe it's the Michael Rubins or the Robert Krafts
Or the billionaire from Marcy, and the way they got my back, uh
See how I prevailed now they try to knock me back, uh
Locked me in a cell for all them nights and I won't snap, uh
Two-fifty a show and they still think I'm sellin' crack, uh
When you bring my name up to the judge, just tell him facts
Tell him how we fundin' all these kids to go to college
Tell him how we ceasin' all these wars, stoppin' violence
Tryna fix the system and the way that they designed it
I think they want me silenced (Shush)
Oh, say you can see, I don't feel like I'm free
Locked down in my cell, shackled from ankle to feet
Judge bangin' that gavel, turned me to slave from a king
Another day in the bing, I gotta hang from a string
Just for poppin' a wheelie, my people march through the city
From a cell to a chopper, view from the top of the city
You can tell how we rockin', soon as I pop up we litty
Poppin' like Bad Boy in '94, Big Poppa and Diddy
And niggas counted me out like my accountant ain't busy
That's five milli' in twenties, sit up and count 'til I'm dizzy
Phantom 500 thousand, hundred round in a stizzy
Is we beefin' or rappin'? I might just pop up with Drizzy like

[Chorus: Meek Mill & JAY-Z]
What's free?
Free is when nobody else could tell us what to be
Free is when the TV ain't controllin' what we see
Told my niggas, "I need you"
Through all the fame, you know I stayed true
Pray my niggas stay free
Made a few mistakes but this ain't where I wanna be
Before I'm judged by 12, put a 12 on my V
Told my niggas, "I need you"
Stay up, I know these times ain't true (Run it down)
Real life, what's free?

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
In the land of the free, where the blacks enslaved
Three-fifths of a man, I believe's the phrase
I'm 50 of D'USSÉ and it's debt free (Yeah)
100 of Ace of Spades, worth half a B (Uh)
Roc Nation, half of that, that's my piece
Hunnid percent of TIDAL to bust it up with my Gs, uh
'Cause most of my niggas won't ever work together
You run a check up but they never give you leverage
No red hat, don't Michael and Prince me and 'Ye
They separate you when you got Michael and Prince's DNA, uh
I ain't one of these house niggas you bought
My house like a resort, my house bigger than yours
My spou- (Come on, man)
My route better, of course
We started without food in our mouth
They gave us pork and pig intestines
Shit you discarded that we ingested, we made the project a wave
You came back, reinvested and gentrified it
Took niggas' sense of pride, now how that's free?
And them people stole the soul and hit niggas with 360s, huh
I ain't got a billion streams, got a billion dollars
Inflating numbers like we 'posed to be happy about this
We was praisin' Billboard, but we were young
Now I look at Billboard like, "Is you dumb?"
To this day, Grandma 'fraid what I might say
They gon' have to kill me, Grandmama, I'm not they slave
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, check out the bizarre (Ah)
Rappin' style used by me, the H-O-V
Look at my hair free, carefree, niggas ain't near free
Enjoy your chains, what's your employer name with the hairpiece?
I survived the hood, can't no Shaytan rob me
My accountant's so good, I'm practically livin' tax free
Factory, that's me
Sold drugs, got away scot-free
That's a CC, E-copy
Guilt free, still me
And expect me to not feel a way to this day
You would say y'all killed me
Sucker free, no shuckin' me, I don't jive turkey
Say "Happy Thanksgiving," shit sound like a murder to me
Smoke free, all of y'all callin' out toll free
Label rob you for millions yet you wanna put a hole in me
Sugar free, seasoned but I'm salt free
You lay a hand on Hov, my shooter shoot for free
I promise World War Three
Send a order through a hands free
Kill you in 24 hours or shorter, you can't ignore the hand speed
On god, it's off the head, this improv but it's no comedy
Sign I fail? Hell nah
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha) Hahahahahahahahaha

Lonesome Train by Stan Kenton

Make love to me while I listen to the lonesome train
Stay close to me while I listen to the lonesome train
Joggin' up the hill
Out there in the lonesome rain
Thrill me tonight while I listen to the lonesome train
Hold me so tight while I listen to the lonesome train
Joggin' up the hill
Out there in the lonesome rain
Say things to me while I listen to the lonesome train
Whisper to me while I listen to the lonesome train
Joggin' up the hill
Out there in the lonesome rain
Lonesome rain
Lonesome train

Now they can't resist us, hear 'em tryna diss us
Really need to miss us, prolly with your bitch, bruh
I bought her purse off a piece of my endorsement
Richer than my classmates, she know how my kids taste
Now I'm on this cash race, I can't come in last place
I done finally went legit, accountants, I'm a taxpayer
So you know that mean I'm goin' hard 'til my last day
Still can get a thousand pounds a week, the gas way

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I got six watches, I'm ahead of time
I m goin' all out if it's 'bout mine
I m gettin' my shine on, I been on my grind
Feel like I'm different, I'm one of a kind
Buy her a Birkin Bag, keep her up to par
Baby, you look better naked, you should take it off
Had to play my role, now I'm takin' charge
Just got off parole, made the brodie take the charge

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Bendin' through in that Phantom with them sticks, yeah (Skrrt, skrrt)
All these blues, niggas asking am I Crip yet? (Cuzzo)
Make a move we X you out, ain't goin' tic tac (Brrt)
Put a tag on your toe for all that chit chat (Yeah, yeah)
The richest nigga in my city, that's a big fact (Big fact)
And we don't do them lil' planes, we on the big jet (Big jet)
My dawg still movin' that 'caine, and he ain't quit yet (He ain't quit yet)
I had to tell him when he came, "Don't bring no bricks back"
Feel like I'm the chosen one (Woah)
Rolls truck, I ordered one (Woah)
I ain't mean to buy that bitch a watch, but I bought her one (Ah)
Richard Millie cost a quarter milli', I got more than one (Yeah)
FN on me lighter than a bitch, feel like a water gun (Gang)

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I got six watches, I'm ahead of time
I m goin' all out if it's 'bout mine
I m gettin' my shine on, I been on my grind
Feel like I'm different, I'm one of a kind
Buy her a Birkin Bag, keep her up to par
Baby, you look better naked, you should take it off
Had to play my role, now I'm takin' charge
Just got off parole, made the brodie take the charge

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
Livin' like a pornstar
Rollie, 7 pointers
Opps finna join us but we ain't switching sides
Neck look like a freezer, ain't savin' no skeezer
They gave me a reason, now they gotta die
I don't want no smoke with you if you don't want no smoke with me
But dawg if you want smoke with me, we switchin' shifts, sleep and creep
I did what they couldn't do, guess that's why they mad at me
But what's up with yo vibe, dawg, why she keep on addin' me?
This my strategy
Keep on stackin' Gs, make 'em proud of me
I went Prada Tees, I went Prada jeans
I want Prada fleece, I'm from poverty
Real talk

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I got six watches, I'm ahead of time
I m goin' all out if it's 'bout mine
I m gettin' my shine on, I been on my grind
Feel like I'm different, I'm one of a kind
Buy her a Birkin Bag, keep her up to par
Baby, you look better naked, you should take it off
Had to play my role, now I'm takin' charge
Just got off parole, made the brodie take the charge

Better To Lie (with Jesse & Swae Lee) by benny blanco

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
Sometimes, it's better to lie than say all the things I got on my mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes, I wonder if I'm livin' my life waiting to die
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes, it's better to lie than say all the things I got on my mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes, I wonder if I'm livin' my life waiting to die
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Jesse Rutherford]
Small dog in that big town
Little dog in that big pound
If you can't bite, then just sit down
Better fight it, just quit now
Full of bull like a pit now
Talking shit with that big mouth
Get written out that script, ouch (Bye)
Like a fish out of the water, this only gets harder
Feels like I just started, no time to get caught
I been working on me, therapy once a week
It ain't cheap, but I'd rather pay the fee
Instead of cheat on you

[Pre-Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
Now you could hate me, I don't mind
Yeah, you could hate me, I don't mind
Yeah, you could hate me, I don't mind
Yeah, you could hate me, I don't mind

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
Sometimes, it's better to lie than say all the things I got on my mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes, I wonder if I'm livin' my life waiting to die
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes, it's better to lie than say all the things I got on my mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes, I wonder if I'm livin' my life waiting to die
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
Killin' the vibes, killin' the vibes
All of this waitin' around, killin' the vibes
Sellin' you dreams, wasting time that I can't buy
Wouldn't give me peace of mind
Attitudes seem to change when we roll up
How'd it taste when you taste your own medicine?
Quality of my life isn't low budget
Gave me all dirty looks when I look back

[Pre-Chorus: Swae Lee]
You can hate me, I don't mind
You can hate me, I don't mind
You can hate me, I don't mind
You can hate me, I don't mind

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
Sometimes, it's better to lie than say all the things I got on my mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes, I wonder if I'm livin' my life waiting to die
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes, it's better to lie than say all the things I got on my mind
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sometimes, I wonder if I'm livin' my life waiting to die
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Pretty good ending, huh?

Calling My Spirit by Kodak Black

[Verse 1]
I put my heart in my lyrics
I gave it all I could give
I made it hot at the crib
I kept that fire at the crib
Where you gon' go when you dip?
How I'ma know who for real?
I pour a four in a fifth
You already know what it is
I keep a pole in the whip
'Cause a lot of these niggas out here envy me
It ain't no ho in the clique
None of my dawgs got fuckboy tendencies
I don't even show no sympathy
Sipping on Hennessy, got me bending sideways
Everything on me drippin', you niggas can't ride the wave
Nigga run around with the juice, nigga come spill your drank
I done earn my stripes now I'm tryna go get me some real rank

[Chorus]
Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel vision
Had to open my mind, then I opened a Benz
It's like you gotta sell your soul for them to pay attention
Fuck all that playing, now I'm grown, I put my heart in it
I had to get down with that chrome to show them niggas I'm serious
And it's like every song I'm on, I be calling my spirits

[Verse 2]
I put my Hublot on rocks
I put Moscato on rocks
Where I m from we don t say opp
Shoot at an OV, shoot at a cop
Shoot at the police, shoot at your top
I made a million off socks
Free all my niggas who stuck in a box
Locked up and watching the clock
Locked up, they fighting with locks
Locked up, they swinging they knifes
I can't be living this life
No more Bacardi, alright
I don't want Cardi so I'ma pour Henny on ice
My vision is vivid, told you I'm really a menace
I'll show you I'm destined to get it
I be outside with the glizzy
Toting that fire, I be trippin'
I just might die how I'm livin'
Ain't take no bath, but I'm drippin'
Niggas ain't catching me slipping, ayy, yeah
I make you laugh when you with me
Know that my swag is terrific (Glee, glee)
Ain't seen my dad in a minute
But I can't be mad, I got millions
I just pulled up in a lemon
Thuggin', so fuck your opinion
I'm thuggin', so fuck how you feeling
I'm calling my spirit

[Chorus]
Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel vision
Had to open my mind, then I opened a Benz
It's like you gotta sell your soul for them to pay attention
Fuck all that playing, now I'm grown, I put my heart in it
I had to get down with that chrome to show them niggas I'm serious
And it's like every song I'm on, I be calling my spirits

Train food by XXXTENTACION

[Chorus]
I remember I had walked home that day
Content with all my misery
Told myself it'd get better, no clue what there was next for me
Remember there was people, walkin', talkin' in the distance
I was dressed for winter weather
But the summer rays were kissing me, I 
I was lost

[Verse 1]
So I took a different path
In the distance he awaited me
Had no weapon, I'm guessin' his hands were just enough for me
Was no question, I'm guessin' he laughed just at the sight of me
I was lost

[Chorus]
I remember I had walked home that day
Content with all my misery
Told myself it'd get better, no clue what there was next for me
Remember there was people, walkin', talkin' in the distance
I was dressed for winter weather
But the summer rays were kissing me, I 
I was lost

[Verse 2]
And there he was, his presence was alarming
As he approached, was casual, we talked 'bout self-harming
He told me, "Kid, you shouldn't be walkin' on your own"
He smiled and laughed, and pat my back
He asked, "How far are you from home?"
I said, "Maybe 30 minutes"
His frequency distorted quick, I seen it in his image
I should've run right fucking there, a

[Verse 3]
You ever woke up on a train track, with no motherfuckin' clothes on?
Death before your eyes, you prayin' to God, but ain't no response
Tryna scream for hope, just a shoulder that you can lean on
But ain't nobody comin', so you scream on and scream on and scream on
While this evil fuck laugh at you
Train getting closer, you still surprised that he battered you
Tears falling harder and harder, minutes get minuscule
Could've had a son or a daughter, now what you finna do?
You finna die here on this train track
'Cause clearly after death, ain't no way you can find your way back
Thinking 'bout your previous memories, going way back
All them fucking dreams 'bout a diamond chain and a Maybach
Now your time finally up
Ask yourself this final question, is you going down or up?
Recollectin' all the moments that you never gave a fuck
Now it's here, death has now arrived, time's finally up

One Minute (feat. Kanye West & Travis Barker) by XXXTENTACION

[Verse: Kanye West]
So much hate at the top, it's a lonely place
When you find out the opps ain't the only snakes
And your spouse only know what you don't erase
The world only know you by your worst mistakes
So spaz on they ass, that's the only way
Smash on the gas down Stony, ayy
Crash and come back with a swollen face
And when I'm on my way, X hold the gate
Terrorize shit, we don't negotiate
If you bitch-made, we don't associate
Show up at your birthday if you owe me cake
With a black mask, that's how we exfoliate
So pardon my way, my heart's in the way
I follow my thoughts, ain't no logic in Ye
Said that's all I'ma say, if he caught him a case
Then send him to jail, like a dog in a cage
I ain't feeling the age, no rottin' away
You're dark as the days, you caught in the way
'Cause coffins is laid under a tombstone
'Cause even when you die, they still throwin' rocks at your graves
So follow the wave, can't swallow the hate
My mind trumps anything that a scholar could say
Don't know how to behave, we rage out of the raves
Dislocate an arm, just pop it in place
'Cause the damned, they ain't it, all the pain and anguish
Turned me into a man, so I ain't complainin'
Now these things is changin', no more lames is hanging
No more fame in famous, ain't no shame in shamin'
She wanna give you the cookie, you Famous Amos
She gave you the pussy, but you ain't pay for the anus
Now your name is tainted, by the claims they paintin'
The defendant is guilty, no one blames the plaintiff
Gotta say it in Layman's terms, while you wait on arraignments
'Cause if the jury say you did it, the payment is heinous
Give me one minute, my lady just fainted
My babies is crying, you understand what I'm sayin'?

Now I'm eatin' calamari, no more sloppy joe
Choke sandwich in my mansion, tryna save for dinner

Codeine in my liver, I'm sippin' hydro
I'm blowin' nitro, smokin' jetpack
Hatin' on a street nigga, can't respect that
I wanna jump out in a crowd, but I be scared to do it

In My Head by Peter Manos

[Verse 1]
I know it's not the same
But I feel it any way
Tell me if that's okay
No, I'll be on my way
Should've known, now I feel insane
Am I insane?

[Pre-Chorus]
I've waited way too long
Yeah, I know you've changed
You have a different face to me
I guess that I was wrong
I'm the one to blame
And that's a shame, you see

[Chorus]
Uhh-uh-uh, you're in my head
And I keep on forgettin'
Uhh-uh-uh, you're here instead
And it seems never ending
Uhh-uh-uh-uhh, I know, I know you've changed
You don't feel the same
Uhh-uh-uh, you're in my head

[Verse 2]
You say it's all alright
But you're not who's up at night
You'll probably say "we tried"
This feels like all a lie
While you tend to try and hide
Your hold has got me tight

[Pre-Chorus]
I've waited way too long
Yeah, I know you've changed
You have a different face to me
I guess that I was wrong
I'm the one to blame
And that's a shame, you see

Uhh-uh-uh, you're in my head
And I keep on forgettin'
Uhh-uh-uh, you're here instead
And it seems never ending
Uhh-uh-uh-uhh, I know, I know you've changed
You don't feel the same
Uhh-uh-uh, you're in my head

[Verse 3]
And nothing else is right
You're laced inside my mind
I'm holding on, I know it's wrong
But I can't see your side
And everything has changed
You're only in my brain
I can't seem to let this be
But I guess I'll refrain

[Chorus]
Uhh-uh-uh, you're in my head
And I keep on forgettin'
Uhh-uh-uh, you're here instead
And it seems never ending
Uhh-uh-uh-uhh, I know, I know you've changed
You don't feel the same
Uhh-uh-uh, you're in my head

[Chorus]
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudy
Join in any reindeer games

Then, one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
"Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"

Then, how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee
Rudy the Red-Nosed Reindeer
You'll go down in history

With truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of his righteousnes
And wonders of his love
And wonders of his love
And wonders, and wonders of his love

Y'all niggas show price less than my travel fee
One of my arms worth a ticket
Watch so much that a car came with it
Back in the day I used to rob with no mask on
Shit on my wrist, I woulda killed the whole house for
And I went to school high, I ain't go to class though
I was with the OGs learnin' 'bout the glass bowl
Caught me with a deuce five, mama kicked my ass, bro
Break yourself, leave his brains on the dashboard

Do You Hear What I Hear? by Bing Crosby

Do you hear what I hear?

Said the night wind to the little lamb
Do you see what I see?
Way up in the sky, little lamb
Do you see what I see?
A star, a star, dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite
With a tail as big as a kite

Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear?
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear?
A song, a song, high above the trees
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea

Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king
Do you know what I know?
In your palace warm, mighty king
Do you know what I know?
A Child, a Child shivers in the cold
Let us bring Him silver and gold
Let us bring Him silver and gold

Said the king to the people everywhere
Listen to what I say
Pray for peace, people everywhere
Listen to what I say
The Child, the Child, sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light

Baby, It's Cold Outside by Dean Martin

[Verse 1: Marilyn Maxwell & Dean Martin]
I really can't stay (But, baby, it's cold outside)
I've got to away (But, baby, it's cold outside)
This evening has been (Been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice (I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)
My mother will start to worry (Beautiful, what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)
So, really, I'd better scurry (Beautiful, please don't hurry)
But maybe just a half a drink more (Put some records on while I pour)
The neighbors might think (Baby, it's bad out there)
Say, what's in this drink? (No cab's to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)
I ought to say "No, no, no, sir" (Mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense in hurtin' my pride?)

[Chorus: Marilyn Maxwell, Dean Martin & Both]
I really can't stay
(Oh, baby, don't hold out)
Baby, it's cold outside

[Verse 2: Marilyn Maxwell & Dean Martin]
I simply must go (But, baby, it's cold outside)
The answer is no (But, baby, it's cold outside)
Your welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at the storm)
My sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon the tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before)
I've gotta get home (But, baby, you'd freeze out there)
Say, lend me a coat (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you got pneumonia and died)

[Chorus: Marilyn Maxwell, Dean Martin & Both]
I really can't stay
(Get over that cold out)
Baby, it's cold
Baby, it's cold outside

Bells are ringin', children singin'
All is merry and bright
So hang your stockings and say your prayers
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have - but I have it by Lana Del Rey

[Verse 1]
I was reading Slim Aarons and I got to thinking that I thought
Maybe I'd get less stressed if I was tested less like
All of these debutantes
Smiling for miles in pink dresses and high heels on white yachts
But I'm not, baby, I'm not
No, I'm not, that, I'm not

[Chorus]
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on my walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't work in my notepad
Don't ask if I'm happy, you know that I'm not
But at best, I can say I'm not sad
'Cause hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have

[Verse 2]
I had 15-year dances
Church basement romances, yeah, I've cried
Spilling my guts with the Bowery Bums
Is the only love I've ever known
Except for the stage, which I also call home, when I'm not
Servin' up God in a burnt coffee pot for the triad
Hello, it's the most famous woman you know on the iPad
Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say, "Hi, Dad"

[Chorus]
I've been tearing up town in my fucking white gown
Like a goddamn near sociopath
Shaking my ass is the only thing that's
Got this black narcissist off my back
She couldn't care less, and I never cared more
So there's no more to say about that
Except hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman with my past

[Bridge]
There's a new revolution, a loud evolution that I saw
Born of confusion and quiet collusion of which mostly I've known
A modern day woman with a weak constitution, 'cause I've got
Monsters still under my bed that I could never fight off
A gatekeeper carelessly dropping the keys on my nights off

[Chorus]
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on your walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't look good in my pad
They write that I'm happy, they know that I'm not
But at best, you can see I'm not sad
But hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have

[Outro]
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
But I have it
Yeah, I have it
Yeah, I have it
I have

By yourself, by yourself, by yourself

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
We on a drive, looped in
Two seat ride, couped in
Who gon' slide? Who's in?
Big rocks 'round, new tint
Fleetwood down, new sand
Two seat ride, couped in
Don't leave 'round loose ends
Don't be around new friends, yeah

By yourself, by yourself, by yourself

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
If I give it to you, will you leave?
Tell it to you, will you speak?
Got it tatted on my sleeve
Fell in love overseas
Ass fatter than a peach, uh
Ocean water kinda deep, uh
Rollin' up out the reef, uh
Put me down, straight to sleep

[Refrain: Travis Scott & James Blake]
Lasting like Duracell
Lasting like Duracell
40 days, 40 nights
Feel like a holy night
The lesson's always there
That less is always more
And in the back and forth
I'm not keeping score
Lesson's always there
That less is always more
When you're alone with me
You never come up short
You never come up short
(Never come up short, never come up short, never come )

[Verse 3: James Blake]
Watch the fan as it spins
In my arms, wrapped in
Don't know where you stop
And where I begin
Like I found myself an imaginary friend
And when we stay in
Not missin' anything

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
We just be mile high clubbin'
I'm on a thousand miles runnin'
Hit it, go downtown Sunday
Then move it uptown Monday

[Post-Chorus: James Blake]
Don't wanna see you by yourself, by yourself
By yourself, by yourself, by yourself

[Verse 4: James Blake]
Hi-Vis, never seen
Low-key as it's been
Fell in love overseas
Fell in love like it's easy
Put to sleep without dreams
Under the moonbeam
Call you for no reason
Hold on like it's greasy

[Refrain: Travis Scott, James Blake & Both]
Lasting like Duracell
Lasting like Duracell
40 days, 40 nights
Feel like a holy night
The lesson's always there
That less is always more
And in the back and forth
I'm not keeping score
Lesson's always there
That less is always more
When you're alone with me
You never come up short
You never come up short
(Never come up short, never come up short, never come )

[Outro: James Blake]
Don't wanna see you by yourself, by yourself
By yourself, by yourself, by yourself

Ain't no rules in the street, don't trust 'em
Ran it up and I had to go and bust it
Police 'bout to kick the door, now we gotta flush it
Ridin' on the backstreets thinkin' 'bout my brother
Prayin' that he come home to his loving mother
Can't believe it that I got it all out the gutter

I Guess I Just Feel Like by John Mayer

[Verse 1]
I guess I just feel like
I guess I just feel like
Nobody's honest, nobody's true
Everyone's lyin' to make it on through
I guess I just feel like I'm the same way too

[Interlude]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
I guess I just feel like good things are gone
And the weight of my worries is too much to take on
I think I remember the dream that I had
That love's gonna save us from a world that's gone mad
I guess I just feel like
What happened to that?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I guess I just feel like the joke's gettin' old
And the future is fading and the past is on hold
But I know that I'm open and I know that I'm free
And I'll always let hope in wherever I'll be
And if I go blind, I'd still find my way
I guess I just felt like givin' up today

[Outro]
Mmm, yeah, yeah

Baptized at First Baptist Church
The pastor name was Reverend Johnson (Okay)
Chastised his shirt and matchin' shoes
But had to front, it never bothered him (Okay)
Hurt his pride but he swallowed it (Okay)
Dirt is all that he spotted
And in the dirty south where bodies pilin' up
So high, they block the birds and rerouted 'em (Damn)
Plenty murderers had observers but
You never heard a peep out of them
So many funerals it ain't enough numerals to keep count of them (Woah)
Look, I'm just settin' the scene
Back when I stared at the phone as I'm lettin' it ring
Another collector, they leave us a message
My mama in deficit, must intervene
I bust out the seams, I'm gettin' too big for these britches now
I invest in the dream, I'm destined for green
I got superstar dick for these bitches now
I got superstar dick for these bitches now
And I think about that when I dig 'em out
(When I dig 'em out, when I dig 'em out)

Hear Me Calling by Juice WRLD

[Intro]
Ring, do you hear me calling?
Purps On The Beat
Me no want no drama

[Chorus]
Do you hear me calling?
Do you hear me calling?
Me no want no drama
Not a fighter, a lover
Do you hear me calling?
Do you hear me calling?
Me no want no drama
I just want you, my darling

[Verse 1]
Break away and make a way to make it
Love the way you lookin' when you naked
Treat your heart just like a blunt of OG
Roll it up, I kissed it and I smoke it
Gots to be joking
Where in the fuck did you think you were going?
Foldin' and packin' your clothes like you ain't know I was gon' unfold it
Wine glass full of your emotions
Oh, Pinot Grigio, sippin', beautiful, heaven-soul woman
Me don't know, let me know, let me
In your heart, don't you dare forget me
I'm your fan, your posters on my walls inside my head, yeah, yeah
I'm your fan, your posters on my walls inside my head, yeah

[Chorus]
Do you hear me calling?
Do you hear me calling?
Me no want no drama
Not a fighter, a lover
Do you hear me calling?
Do you hear me calling?
Me no want no drama
I just want you, my darling

[Verse 2]
You drive me insane, no girl make me feel this way
Wait girl, you got your ways, girl you are my getaway
Wait, let me keep you safe
In exchange, give me brain, brain
You my main thing, turn around, bang bang
Hit the beach in LA like you a beach ball
Me and you in the Lambo truck, you start it up and skrrt off
We park after dark at the park by the mansion, take your skirt off
Oh, me can't wait to get all up inside of it
My heart is racing, every time I'm tastin' it
Wait until the drugs fade out
Hate making love when I'm faded
That's because I wanna feel it
Girl, you give me the best feelin'
Yes, girl you're the best, take away stress, love me to death
Even when I'm a mess

[Chorus]
Do you hear me calling?
Do you hear me calling?
Me no want no drama
Not a fighter, a lover
Do you hear me calling?
Do you hear me calling?
Me no want no drama
Not a fighter, a lover
Me no want no drama
I just want you, my darling (Darling)

[Outro]
Ring, do you hear me calling?
Me no want no drama
Ring, do you hear me calling?

Girls Need Love (with Drake) - Remix by Summer Walker

[Intro: Summer Walker]
Honestly

[Verse 1: Summer Walker]
Honestly, I'm tryin' to stay focused
You must think I've got to be joking when I say
I don't think I can wait
I just need it now, better swing my way
I just need some dick, I just need some love
Tired of fucking with these lame niggas, baby
I just need a thug
Won't you be my plug? Ayy
You could be the one, ayy
We could start with a handshake, baby
I'ma need more than a hug

[Chorus: Summer Walker]
Girls can't never say they want it
Girls can't never say how
Girls can't never say they need it
Girls can't never say now
Girls can't never say they want it
Girls can't never say how
Girls can't never say they need it
Girls can't never say now, oh now

[Verse 2: Summer Walker & Drake]
Give it to me like you need it, baby
Want you to hear me screaming, heavy breathing
I don't need a reason, baby
I want it 'til you can't fight
I can give it to you right, babe, oh
I wanna be your healing
I can be real good
Please don't get in your feelings
Ayy, I need some lo-o-o-o-ove
Ayy, I need some lo-o-o-o-ove
Ayy, I need some lo-o-o-o-ove
Ayy, and you can't judge (I won't)

[Verse 3: Drake]
You don't really call on me like you should
Link up, I'll roll through the hood
Problems, but everything's all good, my love
Your nigga doesn't want smoke with me, nah, no way
Trust me, it's all okay, trust me, it's all
You just need some, someone that's calm and patient
Submission, domination
Arched back, deep stroke
White wine, weed smoke
That's my best combination
You just need some dick with no complications
You just need some, you just need some
Late night attention, uncondition
All that you're missing, my babe
Fucked up, shouldn't even have to justify
I get it, I'm on your side, guys get their way all the time
Besides, pleasure not meant for one side
You should just do what's best for your mind
How 'bout I just take my time?
You call up my line, I fall up inside you
Girls need love, too, I know

[Chorus: Summer Walker]
Girls need love, too (Yeah)
Girls, girls need love, too (Ooh)
Girls need love (Let me tell you something)
Girls need love (Girls need loving, too, yeah yeah yeah)
Girls need love, too
Girls need love, too
(So what's a girl to do when she needs loving, too?)
Girls need love, too
Girls need love, too

Pussy on my navigation, that's my destination (Tell 'em)
Please don't never tell on me, baby (Never tell)
That mean don't call 12 on me, baby (Don't call 12)
As long as the meal prepared for me, baby (It's prepared)

Bad Girls (feat. Gucci Mane) by Lil Skies

[Chorus: Lil Skies]
I like good girls, these bad girls, they not meant for me
You get one shot, don't fuck it up, turn to my enemy
I can't feel your vibe if you telling lies, that's not my energy
Girl, that's not my energy, so get the fuck away from me

Takin' my time
They talkin' shit through the 'vine
Don't let it get to my mind
Chills down her spine
She play it back like rewind
I see the heights and I climb
Not 'fraid to jump
I got the work in my trunk
Roll up a 'Wood of that skunk
These niggas suck
How you talk down but gave up?
She look good with no makeup
She's not a Barbie, she's not a groupie
She's not a girl that you see in the movies
Is he a rockstar? He got an Uzi
He's with the bad guys and he is shooting
Thought he was winning but he is losing
She like the ballers, dudes who be hooping
I was on lay low, stack up while moving
I like the good ones, sorry for choosing

[Bridge: Lil Skies]
She's a good girl, she do what I say so
We both grind hard and go get those pesos
Said she feelin' lucky, might fuck her by the rainbow
We know that these lames know they ain't never getting close
I inhale the good smoke, blow it out the window
I brought the whole gang with me, this is for my kinfolk
You was always lane switching, thought you was for this side
No, you can't be choosing sides, I am just too out of sight

I like good girls, these bad girls, they not meant for me
You get one shot, don't fuck it up, turn to my enemy

Girl, that's not my energy, so get the fuck away from me
I like good girls, these bad girls, they not meant for me
You get one shot, don't fuck it up, turn to my enemy
I can't feel your vibe if you telling lies, that's not my energy
Girl, that's not my energy, so get the fuck away from me

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Woke up in a big old white mansion, I make Obama moves
My chick so bad but still fuck me like she got somethin' to prove
If you be good to big Gucci then I'll be good to you
I'm not too hood for you, baby, I'm just not into you
I don't want no mediocre, I'm not no average joker
Big old white diamond choker, I think I'm Casanova
This ain't no interview, lady, you askin' crazy questions
They see me flexin', VVS's in my diamond necklace
McLaren drivin' reckless, Trap God, don't miss your blessin'
Good girl, come get your lesson, Lil Skies, these bitches tellin'
I sold so many records, I know so many felons
And I see these bitches checkin', and I see these niggas jealous

What A Time (feat. Niall Horan) by Julia Michaels

[Verse 1: Julia Michaels]
I feel a little nauseous and my hands are shaking
I guess that means you're close by
My throat is getting dry and my heart is racing
I haven't been by your side
In a minute, but I think about it sometimes
Even though I know it's not so distant
Oh, no, I still wanna reminisce it

[Chorus: Julia Michaels]
I think of that night in the park, it was getting dark
And we stayed up for hours
What a time, what a time, what a time
You clinged to my body like you wanted it forever
What a time, what a time, what a time
For you and I
What a time, what a time
For you and I

[Verse 2: Niall Horan]
I know we didn't end it like we're supposed to
And now we get a bit tense
I wonder if my mind just leaves out all the bad parts
I know we didn't make sense
I admit it that I think about it sometimes
Even though I know it's not so distant
Oh, no, I still wanna reminisce it

[Chorus: Julia Michaels & Niall Horan]
I think of that night in the park, it was getting dark
And we stayed up for hours
What a time, what a time, what a time
You clinged to my body like you wanted it forever
What a time, what a time, what a time
For you and I
What a time, what a time
For you and I

I been goin' through emotions, bloody emotions
Pour me a cup, I'ma nod out
Started pack smokin', good dope rollin'
Maybe Mary Jane'll help me put the pills down
Dead inside, catch a look at my ghost
I pull up in a Lambo' or 'Rari or Rolls
Got my girl by my side and they callin' us goals
Numb the pain, take these Percs to the mouth and the nose
I'm not a drug addict, got it all wrong
I'm just a love addict 'til my heart gone
I'm just a love addict with the love songs
You with me is where you belong

Flaws And Sins by Juice WRLD

[Intro]
Vibe on this bitch, though
A lighter
Nah, in the room
Oh
Uh-huh

[Verse 1]
You work numbers, work wonders
You done woke me up from my eternal slumber
I'm the lightning, you re the thunder
There's a difference 'tween, "I need you," and, "I want you"
Girl, I need you
Good sex led to conversations getting a little deeper, uh
Tell me your darkest secrets, shit you wouldn t even tell Jesus, uh
My karma been tweaking so much, I don't even believe in karma
But you give me a reason to thank God for all these recent falls
Percocet 30, he ate, all them getting off
I done chilled out on the drugs since you've been involved
Suck it like it's law, fuck me like it's law
No protection on my heart, God damnit, I'm gon' hit it raw
Traumatized from my past, yeah, I keep a log
In my mind, in my head, where that shit belong
They say you after my bread, shit, I hope they wrong
You already ran up the bands, we could have a ball
Hit it from the back, humina, call a play, huddle up
This that good love in the bedroom
Fuck you in the Prada, poke her face like Lady Gaga
Ride it like a Mazda, zoom zoom zoom

[Chorus]
I'm all, I m really all in
In love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
Ain t that a weird way to give compliments?
I'm all I m really all in
I fell in love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
I see light in all the darkness

[Verse 2]
Whoa
'Atta boy, I done turned to a man
Hot chills when my skin is on your skin
Hope that you know that if you ever try to end
You gon' catch a couple out the F&N
That mean Cupid ain't give you a headshot
So I ain t got no choice but to leave you with a headshot
Look at the way I make that fucking bed rock, uh
Where your ring finger at? I need wedlock
Got my sights on your ass, ooh, red dot
We some bats that made it out of Hell, ooh, red hot
Don't, ayy, go all night, bitch, don't stop
We ain't even gon' be finished 'til the sun's out

[Chorus]
I'm all, I'm really all in
In love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
Ain't that a weird way of giving compliments?
I'm all, I'm really all in
In love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
That's my way of giving compliments
I'm all, I'm really all in
In love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
Ain't that a weird way to give compliments?
I'm all, I'm really all in
I fell in love with all your flaws and sins
Your scars are really gorgeous
I see light in all the darkness

Feeling by Juice WRLD

[Intro]
This the one take gang, this the next lil'...
This the one take gang song (Yeah, uh-huh)
Perc' give me a feelin'
Wockhardt just walked into the building
Huh, uh
Percs give me a feeling, I feel it (I feel it, ayy)
Percs give me a feeling, I feel it (Man, goddamn)
Like the Black Eyed Peas

[Chorus]
I got a feeling
Percs help me feel it, I feel it, uh
Problems, I numb and conceal them
Kinda like my feelings, but I still feel them
I just walked in the building
Look like a million, but I'm worth more than a million
I don't need no Ritalin, I'm focused on the millions
Disregard civilians
Until I get a house with a moat and a pavilion

[Verse 1]
I reek of good vibes
Smokin' on reefer, I'm high
Percocet fever
The type of pill to make you scratch until your nails gone (Yeah, yeah)
Drugs in my head, you heard what I said
No five, no ten, no fifteen, twenty, just Perc-30's in my meds
I told my mama I'm here to stay, no, she won't catch me dead
I'm too much of an idol, nigga, no Ryan Seacrest
Do it by my V-lone, 'lone
(This is about you, not me)
Alone, alone, alone (Slatt)

[Chorus]
I got a feeling
Percs help me feel it, I feel it, uh
Problems, I numb and conceal them
Kinda like my feelings, but I still feel them
I just walked in the building
Look like a million, but I'm worth more than a million
I don't need no Ritalin, I'm focused on the millions
Disregard civilians
Until I get a house with a moat and a pavilion

[Verse 2]
'Til I get a house with a moat and a pavilion
Walked into your building, nigga, I'm a villain
Feel like Dragon Ball, bitch, I'm Goku and you Krillin
Bickin' back, I'm boolin', these niggas be chillin'
All up in they feelings, me, I'm just winning
W-I-N-N-I-N-G (Spell it)
Boy, it's ain't no "I" in team but it's an "M-E" in team (Fuck)
I meant it's a "me" in team (Yeah)
I know I just fucked up, but bitch, I'm still the freestyle king, whoa
Her pussy wetter than olive oil, my watch cost a hundred more
My new girl a Lamborghin', your girl a Honda Accord
Mama told me I gotta stay focused, told her I am not a Ford
Focused, you notice when it disappear like hocus pocus

[Chorus]
I got a feeling
Percs help me feel it, I feel it, uh
Problems, I numb and conceal them
Kinda like my feelings, but I still feel them
I just walked in the building
Look like a million, but I'm worth more than a million
I don't need no Ritalin, I'm focused on the millions
Disregard civilians
Until I get a house with a moat and a pavilion (Let's go, let's go, let's go)

Ring Ring (with Rvssian feat. Clever) by Juice WRLD

[Intro: Juice WRLD]
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
I wish everyone would leave me alone
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Ring, ring-ring
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Everyone should just leave me alone
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
But I don't feel like bein' alone
I can't deal with the chills on my own
Freezin' all night long
I can't tell what's real or where I belong

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
Uh, day-to-day same thoughts
This is all the devil's fault
I ain't mean to name drop
Off three, I pop, all three, I'm off, all three
Should make it four like the rings on my Audi
Xans with the Everclear got me seein' foggy
Ironic how somethin' clear got me seein' foggy
Something ain't right 'bout the pills but I bought them
Something ain't right with my mind so I lost it
Drugs turn my knob, then I run, that's a faucet
But it ain't water, it's wine
I'm tired, I'm tired of gettin' high, it's exhausting
I was told it gets better with time

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Ring, ring-ring
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Everyone should just leave me alone
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
But I don't feel like bein' alone
I can't deal with the chills on my own
Freezin' all night long
I can't tell what's real or where I belong

[Verse 2: Clever]
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Unless a Postmates' comin' on the way
But my cellphone isn't well-known
Go the hell on
"Pretty please, get me these
Buy me this, buy me that," bitch, hit your knees
I wasn't prepared for a guest
I'm aware of the stress, I don't care to impress
Can't you see that I am high on drugs?
And low on the sleep
I just wanna go somewhere and count my sheep
I'm tired, I'm tired
Gettin' high is exhausting
But I was told it gets better with time

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Ring, ring-ring
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
Everyone should just leave me alone
I don't feel like comin' to the phone today
But I don't feel like bein' alone
I can't deal with the chills on my own
Freezin' all night long
I can't tell what's real or where I belong

[Verse 2: Roddy Ricch & Post Malone]
Bustin' out my jeans, I got big racks (Hey)
We gon' pull up in the Cullinan in double G (Wow)
I keep a ticket on me, nigga, ain't nothin' to me
I'm draped down in Givenchy
I just put blue guts in the 'Rari
Rich niggas only in this section, I'm sorry
Bust down watch and shades by Bvlgari
I'm smokin' on jet fuel like Bob Marley
I spend a hundred thousand on my necklace, check
Real street nigga from the set, mmh, check
I was in the projects, now I'm on the jet
I ain't even tryna talk if it ain't about a check, yeah

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Hundred bands in my pocket, it's on me
Hundred deep when I roll like the army
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow"
Hundred bands in my pocket, it's on me (On me)
Yeah, your grandmama probably know me
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow"

[Verse 3: Tyga & Post Malone]
Brand new everything, yeah
Tell your friend to stop it, come here (Wow)
No drinks in the Rolls Royce, just got it (Yeah)
She wanna bounce on my dick, tell her friend 'bout it (Hah)
And the party ain't a party 'til I'm inside it (Nope)
If they lick it up, then they invited (Wow)
Mighty Duck ice challenge
And I'm looking for a freak with no mileage
I'm back on my shit, fuck how you feel about it (Fuck)
Big diamonds on my neck, can't even hide it (No)
Shake that ass though, shake that ass though (Wow)
In the bathroom, in a bathrobe
In the front seat of the Lambo'
Bad bitches on the West Coast
Got 'em sayin', "Wow" (Wow)

[Chorus: Post Malone & Tyga]
Hundred bands in my pocket, it's on me (Yeah)
Hundred deep when I roll like the army (Yeah, yeah)
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" (Wow, wow)
Hundred bands in my pocket, it's on me (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, your grandmama probably know me (Yeah, yeah)
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow"

Almost (Sweet Music) by Hozier

[Verse 1]
I came in from the outside, burned out from a joy ride
She likes to roll here in my ashes anyway
Played from the bedside is "Stella by Starlight"
That was my heart, the drums that start off "Night and Day"

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The same kind of music haunts her bedroom
I'm almost me again, she's almost you

[Chorus]
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

[Verse 2]
Tell me who, and I'll be thanking them
The numbered lovers of Duke Ellington
Do I owe each kiss to lip and cheek as soft as Chet can sing
Let's get lost and let the good times roll
Let smoke rings from this paper doll
Blow sweet and thick 'til every thought of it don't mean a thing

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I got some colour back, she thinks so, too
I laugh like me again, she laughs like you

[Chorus]
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

[Bridge]
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't, mmm
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know

[Verse 3]
The very thought of you and am I blue?
A love supreme seems far removed
I get along without you very well some other nights
Oh, the radio news reader chimes
Reporting Russian lullabies
She'll turn to me awake and ask, "Is everything alright?"
And, Lord

[Chorus]
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

Price On My Head (feat. The Weeknd) by NAV

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Yeah, I pull up to my town with a price on my head
I pull up to my town, I'm outside
They wanna see me drown, it s on sight's what they said
I heard these niggas want to take my life
I don't apologize, I would die for this shit
I don t apologize, I don't hide
I'm Kubrick with the shine, got the ice on my neck
They wanna throw a bag on him

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Price on my head, got a price on my head
Night when I rest, with a knife by my bed
I'm so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I'm dead
I'm so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I m dead
Price on my head, got a price on my head (Price on my head)
Night when I rest, with a knife by my bed (Knife by my bed)
I m so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I m dead (When I'm dead)
I'm so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I m dead

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
I cut off all my side hoes, in du Cap with a dime though
All these girls been ran through, on the low real snipe mode
I can't sleep, that's insomnia, so much ice like I'm Tonya
All my boys livin' debt free, your squad like Wesley
I want head on a jet ski, she gave me head for a Fendi
For a Prada, she got sexy, for a Lambo or a Bentley
My mansion is no joke, house party like 1 OAK
Weed louder than gun smoke, get high off one toke
You beefin' with yourself, tell the truth
Niggas on your side, they would ride for me too
Still wasting they time, tryna come for me too
I'm too busy, faded in Japan with the crew
With the crew, with the crew, with the crew
Shout out all the girls who've been riding for me too
Niggas want me dead, I've been dead, nothing new
Niggas want me dead, for a bag and a

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Price on my head, got a price on my head (Price on my head)
Night when I rest, with a knife by my bed (Knife by my bed)
I'm so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I'm dead
I'm so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I'm dead

[Verse 3: NAV]
They tried to get me and they missed, if we send shots then they gon' hit
I could get your top taken off for less than a quarter brick (Yeah)
One of my rings could get him off, we'll check him off the list
My shooter a codeine addict, he'll do it for a pint of Actavis
Since I met Cash, got a lot of racks, I still want more (Racks)
I can tell by the way you carry yourself, you never sold no dope (Dope)
Growin' up, my mama beat my ass, then cleaned my mouth with soap (Soap)
Now she showin' up to work in a Balenciaga coat
Price on my head, got your life 'round my neck
Put a brown kid in the Southside Rex and me is what you'll get
My block was like the car wash, you drive in, you gon' get wet
Had take a lot of losses, made me comfortable with death (Death)
Took too much Act', had to pop a Xan to reset
His bitch gave me some top, and now he wanna send me threats
Live my best life, I know my opps just wanna see me dead
Took his life, I paid him double what they put on my head

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Price on my head, got a price on my head (Price on my head)
Night when I rest, with a knife by my bed (Knife by my bed)
I'm so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I'm dead (When I'm dead)
I'm so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I'm dead
Price on my head, got a price on my head (Price on my head)
Night when I rest, with a knife by my bed (Knife by my bed)
I'm so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I'm dead
I'm so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I'm dead

Confessions of a Dangerous Mind by Logic

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I can't get no better, can t get no more cheddar
I feel like a king and my queen is Coretta
I been made a livin', I'm never gon  give in
I'm just way too driven, that's why I been thinkin'
I'm scared that I'm sinkin', I'm scared that I m fallin 
The world think I'm ballin  and maybe I am
But don't give a damn, back in the beginnin'
Did not have a plan, don't know who I am
Or who I m becomin' but I'ma do me to the fullest, alright
Bustin' and dodgin' them bullets all night
Take over the world, yeah I'm thinkin' I might
Got 'em all in my sight
I know that I'm strong, I know that I am
I know I'm the man
And whether you poor or you filled with financial security
Everyone deal with they own insecurity
Even the preacher was born with impurity
Scared to go out even with my security
Scared of the world and all of its obscurity
Pray for maturity, hope that I grow
Hope my anxiety stay on the low
I swear I hope that shit don't fuck up my flow
Where do I go? What would you do
If suddenly all of your dreams came true?
What would you do if you did it all?
If you ain't never have to lift a finger
Would you linger like, "Fuck 'em all"?
Guess that's your call, but I can't
This a marathon, not a sprint
Switch up the plan like homie that went from Verizon to Sprint
Can you hear me now? Does anybody out there feel me now?

[Chorus]
What's your name? What's your game?
Come now, boy, just spit your flow
Feel the pain with the gain, what you tryna say though?
Novocaine to the brain, I can't feel nothing no mo'
In my lane, can't refrain from lettin' these people know
What's your name? What's your game?
Come now, boy, just spit your flow
Feel the pain with the gain, what you tryna say though?
Novocaine to the brain, I can't feel nothing no mo'
In my lane, can't refrain from lettin' these people know

[Interlude]
How I feel (How I feel), yeah that's how I feel (That's how I feel)
Break it down, roll it up, that's how high I feel (That's how high I feel)
How I feel (How I feel), how high I feel (How high I feel)
Down, roll it up, yeah

[Verse 2]
Searchin' for bliss only led me to searchin' for hits
Only led me to battle depression
I done learned my lesson 'cause fame never lessen the pain
What if your life was under a glass?
And people tried to dig up shit from your past
And tell you what's good and what's not
And every time you drop a song, they say that it's wack or it's hot
And don't give a damn that it came from the heart
They tear it apart like hyenas, this here for the dreamers
This here for the people that know what I'm sayin'
All of the people that know what I'm sayin'
Fuck social media
Tellin' me who I should be and just how I should rap
They always compare, they always compare me to others
And try to hit me up against all my brothers
Now, why you think so many rappers be overdosin' at the crib?
(Overdosin' at the crib)
'Cause people just won't let 'em live
And the public is constantly thinkin' they know 'em
But nobody knowin' what's goin' on inside
And they wonder why we all hide, shit
Maybe I'm just overthinkin'
Or maybe I'm just over-smokin' and drinkin'
And when I can't deal with the hate, I self-medicate
Sit in the corner and think of a better day
Maybe this bullet can help me to get away
I just cannot seem to think of a better way
Even though I know there is, that's why I keep goin'
That's why I keep flowin', that's why I keep perserverin'
Even when I'm hearin' I'm a bitch, I'm a fag
I'm a motherfuckin' hypebeast, I ain't black in the slight least
I ain't good enough, I should quit, I should kill myself (Kill myself)
'Cause "you'll never be Kenny"
"You'll never be better than Drizzy or Cole"
"You're losing your hair, you're too fucking old," yeah
These are the comments I'm readin' on Twitter right now
That make me depressed and they pullin' me down
I'm tryin' to swim but I think I'ma drown
So I'ma turn that feelin' into a sound
And play it when nobody else is around
Whenever I feel like I'm far from the ground
God, give me the power to battle depression
Yeah, round after round
I wish I was famous, I wish I was rich
I wish I could just get up out of this bitch
But be careful what you wish for
'Cause it ain't everything that it's cut out to be
My life is good but not as good as it's 'bout to be
'Cause I got vision, don't fuck with division
Ain't God, but I'm rich and I think that I am
Do what you love and do not give a damn
Fuck all the haters you see on the 'Gram
Just mind your own business and be a good man
Be a good boss and be a good friend
Spread your imagination to the millions
Don't worry 'bout how to maintain all your millions
Just spread that positivity for the children
And all the haters that's hatin', just love 'em
'Cause that's the only way you ever gon' kill 'em
Know somebody feel 'em
Last but not least, put your ego on the shelf
And remember, love yourself
Nah, nah, nah
Put your ego on the shelf and love yourself
Nah, nah, nah
Put your ego on the shelf
And remember, love your 'member, love yourself

[Outro]
Nah, nah, nah
Put your ego on the shelf and love yourself
Nah, nah, nah

Patience by Tame Impala

[Verse]
Has it really been that long?
Did I count the days wrong?
Did we just go 'round and 'round
All the way to step one?

[Pre-Chorus]
They would ask me all the time
Every time the show's up
"So what you doin' with your life?"
It ain't givin' up

[Chorus]
Just growin' up in stages
(Lay down, low down)
Livin' life in phases
Another season changes
And still, my days are shapeless

[Post-Chorus]
It's always drive straight, don't be late
'Cause time waits for no one
I should be flying straight, with no delay
'Cause time takes from everyone

[Bridge]
I'm just laying here
Waiting for a change to come
Take us to the place
Takin' us where we would have gone

[Pre-Chorus]
They would ask me all the time
Showin' up in ages
"So what you doin' with your life?"
Call it givin' up

[Chorus]
I'm just growin' up in stages
(Lay down, low down)
Livin' life in phases
Another season changes
And still, my ways are aimless, I know
We're growin' up in stages
And I'm runnin' out of patience
Growin' up

[Outro]
It's always drive straight, don't be late
'Cause time waits for no one
I should be flying straight, with no delay
'Cause time takes from everyone

Self by Khalid

[Verse 1]
I've ran away for miles
It's gettin' hard for me to breathe
'Cause the man that I've been runnin' from is inside of me
I tell him keep it quiet
So hardly does he speak
'Cause he wants to keep his distance
But it's hard for him to leave
He knows I hear him cryin'
Cryin' out for help
I don't know how to save him
I can't even save myself
There's many people dyin'
I've always been afraid
Not that I'm scared of livin'
I'm scared of feeling pain

[Chorus]
I don't need another hand, I need a couple suggestions
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
Now, does my raw emotion make me less of a man? Hmm
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections

[Verse 2]
I've been so used to winnin'
It was hard for me to lose
No, there's nothing wrong with me
There's just something wrong with you
So I've been making changes
Been workin' on my health
No more competition
Can't compete against myself, no, no, no
I'm not doin' this to be loved, no, no
I've been doin' this to be remembered
Let the people hear it if they want to
Help the one's around me get it on, too
If I die tomorrow and I'm gone
Let the blood run high
Let the carpets drown
I'll be forever now

[Chorus]
I don't need another hand, I need a couple suggestions
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
Now, does my raw emotion make me less of a man? Hmm
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
I don't need another hand, I need a couple suggestions
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
Now, does my raw emotion make me less of a man? Hmm
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections

[Outro]
Let this be a promise
That when it's said and done
Be a flower in the garden
Be one with the sun
Be one with the sun
Be one with the sun
Be one with the sun
Be one with the sun

Kills You Slowly by The Chainsmokers

[Verse 1]
Made plans with me and all your friends
I'm late again, I hate to keep you waiting
Tried to be a gentleman, got drunk again before I even made it
Tried to call a car for you, you're tired of me
I know you wouldn't take it
You walked a mile in Louis Vuittons and fucked 'em up
You know that they're my favorite

[Pre-Chorus]
But we dress up and play pretend
Then we act like we're good again
I do things I can't defend
And even when you hold it in

[Chorus]
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions, hidden when we're in the open
Keep on smilin' until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly

[Verse 2]
Arguments that never end
You're talkin' shit to spice up conversation
I'm so sick of back and forth
These fights with you are startin' to feel contagious
Said that I'm no good for you
Right before we walk into your parents
Then you put on that smile again
And grab my hand even though you hate it

[Pre-Chorus]
But we dress up and play pretend
Then we act like we're good again
I do things I can't defend
And even when you hold it in

[Chorus]
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions, hidden when we're in the open
Keep on smilin' until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't
Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't

[Bridge]
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions hidden when we're in the open
And keep on smilin' until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly

[Chorus]
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
(Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't)
Explosions hidden when we're in the open
(Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't)
Keep on smilin' until it's over
(Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't)
Holdin' even though it kills you slowly
(Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't)

Bad Luck by Khalid

[Intro]
Mmm, mmm
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Alright

[Verse 1]
Don t save me, I'm in no need of saving (Oh yeah)
And if you stay with me, I know you need patience (Yeah, yeah)
Blood and cologne on the fragrance (Mmm, yeah, yeah)
'Cause if ya deal with me, I know you know what pain is (Oh no)

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you're gonna love me
You gotta love all of me
You gotta love, deeper than that
Now, if you're gonna leave me
You better run far away
I d hate for you to leave me attached

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
I m in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
And I don't even like to think about it
On my own, but still so crowded
Walls come down and the guards come up
But there's nowhere to run, I feel surrounded
Hurt feels better when I'm by myself
No one really means it when they're wishing you well
I got no one to call, no one
And people only love you when they're needing your wealth
Damn, laying down, staring at my ceiling fan
Everybody acting like they give a damn
Where is everybody when you need a hand?
I've been burning rubber on the Michelin
Flying in the rain like I'm Superman
I could say I love it, but that just depends

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
I m in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you're gonna love me
You gotta love all of me
You gotta love, deeper than that
Now, if you're gonna leave me
You better run far away
I d hate for you to leave me attached

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
I m in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck

[Outro]
Yeah (I'm in love with bad luck)
Bad, bad luck

Right Back by Khalid

[Verse 1]
Power
Got me sittin' by my phone, I ve been waiting for hours
On my line, sending mirror pics of you fresh out the shower
So I might as well swing over to your place (Mmm, nah)
It s crowded
In LA, but I ll be there at 8 if the traffic allows it
Say you re down, I could show you around
If you re really about it, yeah
But for you, I got something to prove, what do you say?
What do you say?

[Chorus]
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back

[Verse 2]
Saved
Got the weed, we can sit by the beach if we wanna get faded
But if that's not the vibe, yeah, it s cool
We can save it for later, yeah
I just like the way it feels when you're around
When you're around, ah
Now I know we're not dating, nah
Maybe soon by the way things go, we ve been talking for ages
Take it step by step, slow it down, we just need to be patient, love
If the love feels good and it's real, it'll all work out
It'll all work out, yeah

[Chorus]
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back

[Bridge]
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it (So bring it back)
So bring it, so bring it back (So bring it, yeah)
So bring it, so bring it (Yeah)
So bring it, so bring it (Nah)
So bring it, so bring it (Bring it, bring it)
So bring it, so bring it back
So bring it, so bring it (Yeah)
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it back (No no, no, oh yeah)

[Chorus]
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night

I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right

Free Spirit by Khalid

[Verse 1]
We were running onto something
And we didn't say "forever," but it's all we wanted
You were so in love with simple things
And now we're searching for the fire dripped in kerosene
I've been loving more, living less
Off of highs and lows, so obsessed
Couldn't get nothin
But we're never running out

[Chorus]
We'll be free spirits, free spirits
Can you hear me calling?
Oh, it's all or nothing
When you're free spirits, free spirits
Can you hear it calling?
'Cause I don't wanna live and die alone, don't let me go

[Verse 2]
Is this Heaven or Armageddon?
I'll be gettin' high with you to watch the endin'
We were drownin' down our memories
A cemetery full of bottles, man, that liquor bleed
When you're loving more, caring less
It's the highs and lows with no regrets, oh
And we wanted it all then
But we're never running out

[Chorus]
We'll be free spirits, free spirits
Can you hear me calling?
Oh, it's all or nothing
When you're free spirits, free spirits
Can you hear it calling?
'Cause I don't wanna live and die alone, don't let me go

[Bridge]
So tell me when you're falling
No, I can never doubt your love
Can you hear me calling?
Is it everything you're dreaming of?
Leave it all on the night
As long as you're not leaving me behind
On your heart, your heart, ah

[Outro]
Free spirits, free spirit
Free spirits, free spirit

Self by Khalid

[Verse 1]
I've ran away for miles
It's gettin' hard for me to breathe
'Cause the man that I've been runnin' from is inside of me
I tell him keep it quiet
So hardly does he speak
'Cause he wants to keep his distance
But it's hard for him to leave
He knows I hear him cryin'
Cryin' out for help
I don't know how to save him
I can't even save myself
There's many people dyin'
I've always been afraid
Not that I'm scared of livin'
I'm scared of feeling pain

[Chorus]
I don't need another hand, I need a couple suggestions
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
Now, does my raw emotion make me less of a man? Hmm
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections

[Verse 2]
I've been so used to winnin'
It was hard for me to lose
No, there's nothing wrong with me
There's just something wrong with you
So I've been making changes
Been workin' on my health
No more competition
Can't compete against myself, no, no, no
I'm not doin' this to be loved, no, no
I've been doin' this to be remembered
Let the people hear it if they want to
Help the one's around me get it on, too
If I die tomorrow and I'm gone
Let the blood run high
Let the carpets drown
I'll be forever now

[Chorus]
I don't need another hand, I need a couple suggestions
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
Now, does my raw emotion make me less of a man? Hmm
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
I don't need another hand, I need a couple suggestions
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
Now, does my raw emotion make me less of a man? Hmm
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections

[Outro]
Let this be a promise
That when it's said and done
Be a flower in the garden
Be one with the sun
Be one with the sun
Be one with the sun
Be one with the sun
Be one with the sun

Hundred by Khalid

[Verse 1]
Life is never easy when you need it to be
Try to knock me down, but I get back on my feet
Everybody's angry and they're coming for me (Coming for me)
But I can't give them energy that I won't receive (I won't receive)
So I brush 'em off, I got a lot on my sleeve
Like I'm moving backwards, but it's all on repeat
This place is getting crowded, I got no room to breathe
I hope the only thing I'm losing isn't my memory

[Chorus]
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face
I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face
I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today

[Verse 2]
Now it's real, take your time, you're almost there
Wherever we re going, gotta be prepared
We ll be fine, are you scared? Are you scared?
People keep on talking 'bout what they wanna be
Walking down the line, but they don t live what they preach (Live what they preach)
Sharing attributes with all our own enemies
You gotta pay to live and even dying ain't free

[Chorus]
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face
(No, I won't give up, no, I won't give up)
I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today
(Yeah, and I won't be waiting on you)
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face
(No, I won't give up, no, I won't give up, no no)
I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today, yeah

[Bridge]
You gotta take it slow (Alright)
Dust yourself off, don t you lose control (Yeah, mmm)
Gotta take it slow
Dust yourself off, don t you lose control
(Dust yourself off, don t you lose control)
You gotta take it slow (Oh)
Dust yourself off, don t you lose control
(Dust yourself off, don t you lose control)
Gotta take it slow
Dust yourself off, don t you lose control
(Dust yourself off, don t you lose control)

[Chorus]
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face

[Outro]
Outta sight, outta mind, got no time
So blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life
Outta sight, outta mind, got no time
So blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life
Hundred days and I'm still alive
Hundred days and I'm still alive
Its been a hundred, mmm
Hundred, hundred days and I'm still alive
Had a hundred friends, but I cut em off, I don t need em
Not like any of them gave a fuck if I was breathing
Summer's over so they switching around like the seasons
Gotta keep my guard up, now I'm playing defense
Everybody wants a favor, everybody needs me
But I'm too busy trying to fight away all of my demons
I'm too busy trying to fight away all of my demons
Everybody wants a favor, everybody needs me
Outta sight, outta mind, got no time
So blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life
Outta sight, outta mind, got no time
So blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life
Hundred days and I'm still alive
Hundred days and I'm still alive
Its been a hundred, mmm
Hundred, hundred days and I'm still alive

Intro by Khalid

[Intro]
Say you can't deal with me no more, just say you don't want me
I never know what you feel no more, just say you don't want me
Say you can't deal with me no more, just say you don't want me
I never know what you feel no more, just say you don't want me

[Verse]
It's been too much, I've been on the side and I'm waiting
Got a little time, maybe all night, if I'm patient
What's on your mind? I can never read you (I can't)
No, I always leave you crying when we fight, but I don't mean to, yeah
No, no, love don't come easy
Especially when you're loving me, yeah
It's never enough for the both of us, so sorry
Couldn t have known it would ever be this hard
Ooh, we had it all, but we lost and that's our fault
I should be here waiting for you to answer my calls, no
But I'm never giving up on word, I've been
I've been focusing on putting me first
Still could never see you with somebody else
I can't even live with being by myself
That's the part of me that really needs your help
Lately, I haven't been doing very well
That's the difference between heaven and hell
I feel heaven when you're here with me
I feel hell every time you leave
But I need to get you off of my back
I gotta get you off of my back
We said we would never take it this far
Here we are, going back and forth
I hoped we would never make it this far
But now, I gotta find my worth

[Outro]
Say you don't love me no more, just say you don't want me
(Say you don't want me, yeah)
We don't gotta be no more if you really don't want to
(We don't gotta be no more)
Say you can't deal with me no more, just say you don't want me
(Just say you don't want me, yeah)
I never know what you feel no more, just say you don't want me
We don't gotta be, we don't gotta be, yeah, no more
We don't gotta be no more, no more, no more, no more, no

Paradise by Khalid

[Intro]
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, yeah

[Verse 1]
You go searching for paradise
You sit back and close your eyes
We're burning, yet so alive
And now you've got your hands up
Hoping you catch the high
Feels like the summer time
Chasing the northern lights, oh
Don't like watching your momma cry
You say you'd rather die
She says you're wasting your life

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, life don t stop the more we pray
All your wrongs from yesterday
Smokin  himalayan haze
Won t wash all your sins away

[Chorus]
Hate don t give
Love don t rewind all the good times
All the dollars you ll spend
Give it up for nights like this
Don t give into overthinking
Pour a drink when it ends

[Verse 2]
Do you hear me through your speakers
So much distance, space between us
Say you're dreaming and I ve been, too
And no-one knows what you ve been through
And I've been thinking a little deeper
Contemplation, getting cleaner
See no leaders, need more teachers
I'm in shambles, I don't sleep much

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, life don t stop the more we pray
All your wrongs from yesterday
Smokin  himalayan haze
Won t wash all your sins away

[Chorus]
Hate don t give
Love don t rewind all the good times
All the dollars you ll spend
Give it up for nights like this
Don t give into overthinking
Pour a drink when it ends (Overthink)

Yeah, yeah

Twenty One by Khalid

[Verse 1]
You just turned 21, so lately, you've been drinking
Wasted on alcohol you chase to fight the feeling
Thinking 'bout letting go, would that be easy for you then? Yeah
So lay with me, lay with me, we're underneath the bleachers
Stay or leave, stay or leave, I hope you're never leaving
All of these memories crawling underneath your skin, skin (Oh, oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you're in pain, but who's to blame?
All our lives, it never ends

[Chorus]
Yeah, alright
You gotta hold on tight
Yeah, alright, alright

[Verse 2]
Don't believe everything
The shit you like gives you anxiety, but finally
I see you smiling when you say you need privacy
You're only hiding from yourself, mmm, oh
I say I'm fine, coming home
I see the sun come up and shut the blinds
Episodes, I know I never take my own advice when I'm wrong
But I can't do it by myself, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you're in pain, but who's to blame?
All our lives, it never ends

[Chorus]
Yeah, alright (Alright)
You gotta hold on tight
Yeah, alright
You gotta hold on tight

[Bridge]
'Cause I'm in pain, but I'm to blame
To end this fight, I have to change

Power is Power by SZA

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
I was born of the ice and snow
With the winter wolves, in the dark, alone
The wildest night, I became the one
And you'll know you're mine when the silence comes

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Heavy is the crown only for the weak

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
A knife in my heart couldn't slow me down
'Cause power is power, my fire never goes out
I rise from my scars, nothing hurts me now
'Cause power is power
Now watch me burn it down

[Verse 2: SZA]
I been down with the coldest war
And I know where I been 'cause I bled before, yeah
How do I know if I let you stay?
How do I know if we did it your way?
You wouldn't take my place
Put me away, I'd die lookin' up at your face
How do I ever know? Who can I trust?
Feelings of emptiness
Only love could kill me, God bless

[Chorus: The Weeknd, The Weeknd & SZA]
A knife in my heart
Couldn't slow me down (Couldn't slow me down)
'Cause power is power ('Cause power is power)
My fire never goes out
I rise from my scars
Nothing hurts me now (Nothing hurts me now)
'Cause power is power ('Cause power is power)
Now watch me burn it down

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
Breathe, feel the air that I breathe (Yeah)
Air that I, air that I breathe
Who's hotter? Been a monster with a crown
So swamped by high water, keep your head up, you might drown
In this world, it's way colder, by the day, we count it down
Been around, just been waitin' up, she gon' come around
I took a drag, bust it out the gate, my lil baby, slay
I wore a flag, put that on my face, ain't nobody safe
Lift the mask, they gon' have to see what they can't erase
I took a lot, so I took it back (Do-do-do-do-do, yeah)
Danger's on my mind
Ain't no knife, dagger, bullet that can do it
'Fore you, yeah, you know, I go right straight through it, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: SZA]
Heavy is the crown, but never for a queen (Oh yeah)

[Chorus: SZA & The Weeknd, The Weeknd, & Travis Scott]
A knife in my heart
It couldn't slow me down (Couldn't slow me down)
'Cause power is power ('Cause power is power)
My fire never goes out (Oh)
I rise from my scars (Yeah)
Nothing hurts me now (Nothing hurts me now)
'Cause power is power ('Cause power is power)
Now watch me burn it down (Ooh, yeah, yeah)
Now watch me burn it down

Faking like you got it in your pockets, yeah, that's bitch shit
Talking to them hoes, you steady gossip, yeah, that's bitch shit
Telling on your mans so you can scram, yeah, that's bitch shit
Pull it out and acting like it jam, yeah, that's bitch shit
Hating on another nigga come-up, yeah, that's bitch shit
Staying in because you know it's summer, yeah that's bitch shit
You a bitch boy, on my mama, uh

[Verse 2]
Okay, let's get it, bitch, let's get it, woo
Got a plan, we gon' kill his man
The gun won't jam, it's on on sight
I might get life, that's on my life
The .44 fire, the goal green light
To build that price, it filled up nice
The god won't die
Okay, let's get it, bitch, let's get it, woo
See no flaws, in my purest form, bitch, I'm greedy, uh
Goyard tags, filled with hella cash, this my gimme bag
Zeroes add, we don't do no class, nigga, nine subtract, ayy

Homicide by Logic

[Intro: Smokey Legendary, Logic & Both]
Son, you know why you the greatest alive?
Why, Dad?
Because you came out of my balls, nigga
Hahahahahaha
(Roof!)

[Chorus: Logic]
Fuck rap
Bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive
Leave a suicide note, fuck that
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm, chika-chika-chika, Slim Shady with rabies

[Verse 1: Logic]
I'm foamin' at the mouth, ain't nobody takin' me out
Every single rapper in the industry, yeah, they know what I'm about
And I dare you to test me
'Cause not a single one of you motherfuckers impress me
And maybe that's a little bit of an exaggeration
But I'm full of innovation
And I'm tired of all of this high school "He's cool, he's not" rap shit
Can a single one of you motherfuckers even rap? Shit
No, this ain't a diss to the game, this a gas to the flame
Nowadays, everybody sound the same, shit's lame
Like a moth to the flame, I'ma reel 'em in and kill 'em
Know you feelin' lyricism when I'm spillin' it, I'm feelin' myself
Yeah, yeah, Bobby Boy, he be feelin' himself
Mass murder like this can't be good for my health
When I rap like this, do I sound like shit?
Well, it don't really matter, 'cause I'm killin' this shit
Yeah, I'm killin' this shit
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm killin' this shit
Bobby, how many times you been killin' this shit?
Find another rhyme, goddamn, nigga, shit

[Chorus: Logic]
Fuck rap
Bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive
Leave a suicide note, fuck that
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm, chika-chika-chika-chika
Chika-chika-chika-chika-chika, Slim Shady

[Verse 2: Logic]
There's nowhere to hide, we call this shit genocide
Hit 'em with that (Do-do-do) and they die
We gon' leave 'em crucified, we call this shit genocide
I got bitches, I got hoes, I got rare designer clothes
No, we ain't fuckin' with that
Yeah, there's a time and a place
But if you ain't comin' with the illest of raps
Callin' yourself the greatest alive
Then you don't deserve to do that
No, no, oh no, no, please do not do that
You gon' get smacked
You gon' make Bobby attack
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap (Bobby Boy!)

[Chorus: Logic]
Fuck rap
Bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive
Leave a suicide note, fuck that
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm chika-chika-chika-chika
Chika-chika-chika-chika-chika, Slim Shady

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga like JAY-Z
Jig is up, you fuckers who didn't write anything
Are getting washed, liga-liga-liga, like bathing
Young Hova, I know hitters like Yankees
Gun toters that pull triggers like crazy
Unloadin', leave you shot up in your Rover
Your body goes limp and slumps over
Like A-Rod in a month lull, but he just homered
Hol' up, I said "Rover" because now your Rover is red
Like Red Rover, so you know what I meant
But I roll over my opponents instead
Makin' dog sounds 'cause I gotta keep breakin' these bars down
I'll go slow for the speds
But when I go (Roof!) like the Dobermann said
I still think the (Roof!) would go over your head (Ha-ha)
Beast mode, motherfuckers 'bout to get hit
With so many foul lines, you'll think I'm a free throw
Figured it was about time for people to eat crow
You about to get out-rhymed, how could I be dethroned?
I stay on my toes like the repo, a behemoth in sheep's clothes
From the East Coast to the West, I'm the ethos and I'm the G.O.A.T
Who the best, I don't gotta say a fuckin' thing, though
'Cause MCs know
But you don't wanna hear me spit the facts
Your shit is ass like a tailbone
Or you're trapped in your cell phone
Or my chicken scratch, or my self-loathe
I don't wanna fuckin' listen to you spit your raps someone else wrote
Used to get beat up by the big kids
Used to let the big kids steal my big wheel
And I wouldn't do shit but just sit still
Now money's not a big deal
I'm rich, I wipe my ass with six mill'
Big bills like a platypus
A caterpillar's comin' to get the cannabis
I'm lookin' for the smoke but you motherfuckers are scatterin'
Batterin' everything and I've had it with the inadequate
Man, I can see my dick is standin' stiff as a mannequin
And I'm bringin' the bandana back, and the fuckin' headband again
A handkerchief and I'm thinkin' of bringin' the fuckin' fingerless gloves back
And not giving a singular fuck, like fuck rap
I sound like a fuckin' millionaire
With a Derringer with a hair trigger
'Bout to bear hug a fuckin' terrier, the Ric Flair dripper
Y'all couldn't hold a candle at a prayer vigil
When I vent, they compare me to a fuckin' air duct
I'm about to bare-knuckle it, nah, fuck it
I'm gonna go upside their head with a Nantucket
Abraca-fuckin'-dabra
The track is the blood, I'm attracted, I'm attackin' it
What? Dracula, fuck that shit
I'm up, back with a thud
Man, stop

[Outro: Chris D'Elia]
Look what I'm plannin', plannin', I'm plannin' to
Do all this while ya panickin'
And you're lookin' and starin' at mannequins
And I'm goin' to Fanagans
Trying to get up a plan against
All of the blana-kazana-ka-fam-bam-bannigans
While of all the bana-kazanika Hanna in a cabana
You're in a cab-
I'm in a cabana and a Janet
I'm in a cabana chantin' all this standup banter
While you don't got the stamina, you're lackin' the stamina
You're lackin' the stamina while you're divorcin' Harrison Ford
And I'm in a Porsche on the floorboards
While I'm world tourin'
You usin' way too many napkins, papkins
Lapkins and chapki-
You using ChapStick and napkins while I'm bapkin'
Flappin' around like a bapkin'
Flamminababbitapannitajampkin
Dammit, a can of pada-

Yeah

[Chorus]
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves
Get it done, yeah, I get it done, no blood on the leaves
They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe
Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves
Get it done, yeah, I get it done, no blood on the leaves
They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe
Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve, ayy

[Verse 1]
At the Garden, sitting courtside, look around like, "Oh my God"
I just sold this motherfucker out, I ain't even try
I ain't one to floss, but I got plaques, run it back
Once I touch down, I go deep like a running back
Just jumped on the private jet and rolled a joint
Played the beat then wrote that joint
Wrote a whole movie, then I sold that joint
Fuck Illuminati, that boy 6ix got my back
6ix made this beat, 6ix bring the heat you got on repeat
Word on the street
Can't no one compete, I'm spectacular
That boy got the sauce
I don't play no games 'less we talkin' Fortnite
Finally knew I made it, sittin' at the red light
When them soccer moms pull up in they van while I ride
Like, "Oh my God, children, it's the 1-800 guy"
But my doors suicide, yeah, I'm too alive
Bitch, I have arrived, everybody know I'm one hell of a guy
I ain't tryna fuck your girl, I'm tryna fuck your mama
Fuck the drama, bank account got a extra comma
Yeah, they sweat me like the sauna
Red carpet in my own merch, like that shit is designer
Did you know I'm mixed like Obama?
It ain't a project if Logic ain't talkin' 'bout being biracial
Bicoastal, I'm platinum, go postal, I'm snappin'
Yeah, you know Bobby, but prolly' only know my new shit
That trap shit, that cool shit, but they all know that fool spit

[Chorus]
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves
Get it done, yeah I get it done, no blood on the leaves
They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe
Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves
Get it done, yeah, I get it done, no blood on the leaves
They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe
Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve, ayy

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you know you made it when they make a meme for ya
Haters that never made it, I'm livin' the dream for ya
Roll up, grab the kush and then roll up
Hold up, better give me what I want when I show up
You know what I do, not who coming through
How 'bout you?
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool
I don't fuck with nobody like mean girls in high school
I don't give a damn that I'm famous
Why it seem like every single celebrity shameless, it's dangerous
Got 50 million but my swag on food stamps
All these models poppin' bottles, bitch, I ain't tryna dance
She said, "No, I don't wanna pay my bills"
I need a hard workin' woman with respect who will
This for everybody who ain't made it yet
Got five degrees and six figures in debt
Follow your dreams ho, follow your  follow your , uh
Somebody calling your, uh, it's destiny
Hold up with the turn up for a second man, who's testing me?
I got so much power, don't know why the heavens blessing me
PLP, I think that is the recipe
So I'ma take a moment, use my power for good
Fuck the bullshit, do what you love and get out the hood

[Chorus]
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves
Get it done, yeah I get it done, no blood on the leaves
They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe
Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves
Get it done, yeah, I get it done, no blood on the leaves
They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe
Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve, ayy

[Part I]

Turn my lights on
How the fuck you quiet with the mic on?
I don't get anxiety, you Sam Bowie-ass niggas
I just get my Mike on
Y'all said I wouldn't go nowhere, I took the detour
When you see the someone in the crack right by the seashore?
When you see them brand new le Fleurs on the floor?
If the cops ask my name, bitch, I'm Igor

[Chorus]
Yuh, ayo
Yeah, yeah
Let's go, let's go, I ain't playin' around
Red nose, red nose, all you niggas is clowns
Niggas turning it up, well, shit, I'm tearing it down
Hard to believe in God when there ain't no mirrors around
What's up?

[Bridge]
Uh-huh, ayo
Uh-huh
Yeah, yo
Bitch

[Verse 2]

Had them niggas and the cops looking jigsaw
I done fucked around and turned into the big dog
Better get God, get caught? Bitch, I think not
Yeah, new suit, new boots, same nigga, like what?
Lukewarm-ass niggas always wanna talk
I'm hot, I'm heat to the core like Earth
Don't touch, don't go, niggas might get buck

[Chorus]
Yo, yuh, ayo
Yeah, yeah
Let's go, let's go, I ain't playin' around
Red nose, red nose, all you niggas is clowns

I see the light
Now didn't I tell you motherfuckers
Um, I see the light
To pay attention and to keep your motherfucking eyes glued to the man that's in front of you?
I see the light
That's what the fuck I expect all y'all motherfuckers to do
I see the light

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & slowthai]
Dracula, Dracula, Dracula
Suck me first, I might get back at ya (I see the light)
Is that shit clear? Check the aperture
Hahahahaha, I can't laugh at ya (I see the light)
This the shit that make you nervous
'Bout to go buck wild, nigga, Steve Irwin (I see the light)
Sick of that 'Claren talk, I'm on my third one
Niggas talkin' reckless, I never heard 'em (I see the light)

[Chorus: slowthai]
I see the light

I see the light

[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator & slowthai]
That car crash couldn't take me (Woo, ha)
Green haired angels all around me (Uh)
No answer why, no tears to cry, bitch, I'm alive (I see the)
That wasn't my endpoint like v-neck
I ain't have nobody to cheat on, I cheat death
New album, no repeat, I reset
Everything I deliver special like G. Dep
Two of 'em, I total, Kima, Pam
Me and death, the universe played middle man
Quick nap, kick back like horse, eyes shut
Loud sound, no scratch
Motherfuckers really thought I died
Hoping they could take a spot
Nigga not knowing that I'm one of one
And they some Helen Keller-ass niggas
And I got my eyes open now I see the...

[Outro: slowthai & Jerrod Carmichael]
Light
I see the light
You never wanna meet a motherfucker like me
I see the light (I said)
I see the light
I see the light
I don't know what's harder, letting go or just being okay with it

PUPPET by Tyler, The Creator

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo
I wanna talk, I wanna call you and talk
I wanna walk to your front door and knock
After I start my vehicle
Drive to your city 'cause we live an hour apart
Land at your driveway and put it in park
Then do the third line of this verse
Then back to my house and we pack up our bikes
And we ride through the park, chase the sun
God, that's all I want, other than air
Oxygen and financial freedom, yeah
I want your company, I need your company
I want you to want from me
I can't maneuver without you next to me
It's so complex to me

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
What do you need?
Do you need bread? Do you need this?
Do you need a hug? Do you need to be alone?
I could wrap this up and get the fuck away instead
What is your wish? It can be granted
You're number one, one on my list, see, I am Santa
Where is Rudolph? You're parasitic
I do not have self-control
I am startin' to wonder
Is this my free will or yours? (Yours, yours, yours)

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Kanye West]
I'm your puppet, you control me
I'm your puppet, I don't know me
(Did I wait too long?)
I'm your puppet
(Did I wait too long?)
You control me
(Did I wait too long?)
I'm your puppet
(Did I wait too long?)
I'm lonely
'Cause I'm your puppet
(Puppet, oh)
You control me (Control me)
I'm your puppet (Puppet)
I don't know
I'm your puppet (Did I wait too long?)
You control me (Puppet)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You lost, son, and you've been tryna find your way to me
Ayy, to me, he's on somethin' that I hate to see
A to Z, nah son, I'm gonna take a breathe
Run a 'thon, I just stop and I'ma take the breathe
...on a...
...on a...
First, light the weed
First...
First... (Got me by a string)
First... (Got me by a string)
First... (Got me by a string)
(Oh, Lord)

[Outro: Kanye West, Tyler, The Creator & Jerrod Carmichael]

Breathe on a song

Breathe on a song
(Cut me loose)
(La, la, la)
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)

But at some point, you come to your senses

GONE, GONE / THANK YOU by Tyler, The Creator

[Part I: GONE, GONE]

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Comparing scars before dinner
Jump off the roof into the mirror
Felt like summer to my December
Was it my August? Shit, I don't remember
(Two, three, go)
I know my temperature was set
You finally flew south
The bird gon' leave the nest, you're so chromatic
At least I had it (Uh)
Instead of never
Or maybe I'm too dramatic
(Two, three, go)

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
(Two, three, go)
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone

[Post-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
I know love is, is all I got
I just hope to God she got good taste
Could put you on some shit you never seen
Could play a couple songs that you could dance to
I hope you know she can't compete with me

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Gone, gone, gone)
Going, and now I'm scarred for life

[Interlude: CeeLo Green]
My love is gone (Gone), my love is gone (Gone)
My love is gone (It's gone), my love is gone

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo, it's poison in that gumbo
Emotion, feel Dumbo
Ask me where my love go
That bitch walked outside the front door
Knock, knock, knock, knock
I'm not shocked, I brought this on me
It's my fault, you gon' leave
Lesson taught, see
The weatherman told me it wasn't rainin'
My stupid ass brought umbrellas
I got a glimpse of your cloud and felt better
Now it's 90 degrees, and all the tricks up my sleeve
Is drenched in sweat and delusion because I jet to conclusions
You got your thing, I got nothing but memories
I know your secrets, nigga (Yeah)
I'm not bitter or nothing, I understand that
Everybody making a choice according to plan and
We had two different blueprints, but understood influence
You opened up early on, I thought I had a permit
You started buildin' a bridge and turned it into a fence
Then my buildin' got tore down all because of your new tenant
I'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease
You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it
But I finally found peace, so peace
(Want me do it over? Everything)

[Outro: Jerrod Carmichael]
I hate wasted potential, that shit crushes your spirit
It really does, it crushes your soul

[Part II: THANK YOU]

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Thank you for the love
Thank you for the joy
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Thank you for the time
Thank you for your mind, mind
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
(Got my eye)
I said go, go

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]
Thank you for the love
Thank you for the joy
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Thank you for the time
Thank you for your mind, mind
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again

Oh, you keep taking me higher and higher (Yeah)
But don't you know that the devil is a liar? (Yeah, I know)
They'd rather see me down, put my soul in the fire
But we keep goin' higher, higher

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, look

A miscarriage back-to-back every year for like ten
Pregnant with my moms, doctor told her it was slim
Was bed rode for nine months, but gave birth in the end
Pops turned 60, he proud what we done
In one generation, he came from Africa young
He said he met my moms at the Century Club
Los Angeles love kinda of like Hussle and Boog
Mani turned ten, Kross turned two
Startin' to see this life shit from a bird's view
We the ones that made millions off the curb, fool
In this rap shit ten, never made nerd moves

[Chorus: John Legend]
Oh, you keep taking me higher and higher (Yeah)

But we keep goin' higher, higher (Woah, woah)
(Nip, talk to 'em)

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle & John Legend]
Emptied out the clip, it was broad day
Fuck niggas always gotta learn the hard way
We gon' tape it off if we ball play
Put a half a moon crescent on your bald fade
Police hit the lights, that's a car chase
Lookin' back at my life make my heart race
Dance with the devil and test our faith
I was thinkin' chess moves but it was God's grace
Crooked ass whoever 'til we all straight
With no shame, I peeped game and it's all fake
South Central state of mind, high crime rate (Yeah)
Homicide, hate, gang banging'll get you all day (Yeah, yeah)
And look at my fate

[Chorus: John Legend & Nipsey Hussle]
Oh, you keep taking me higher and higher (Yeah)

They'd rather see me down, put my soul in the fire
But we keep goin' higher, higher

[Outro: John Legend]
Higher
Oh, Lord
Can you feel it?
My shoes are scrapin' the sky
I'm so high
We keep goin' higher

Don't get green skin (Green skin), keep contact (Keep contact)
Don't say, "Goodbye, smell you later" (Later)
Nah, I can't
I don't want to end this season on a bad episode, nigga, nah
Bouncing off things and you don't know how you fall
Your power is drained, so you cannot go through walls
You're caught in this matrix, don't know where you play it
You hate it, it could be your favorite if you make it your friend

See, um, heavy feelings for you, yeah, yeah, it's no secret
You too cool for me and I ain't tryna freeze up
Like the Johnsons, nonsense, I would speak up
And realize there's more fish in the sea, I'ma re-up
Like, bitch, I know my shit is bumping, it's eczema
So I won't walk around with my head down like I got beat up
Um, you do you, I'll do me, I ll just chuck the peace up
I ain't tryna keep up, because

[Chorus]
I don't love you anymore (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
'Cause I don't love you anymore (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
'Cause I don't love you anymore (You wasted my time and I know that these things are not hard)
'Cause I don't love you anymore (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
But this just might be better for us, you know?

[Bridge]
('Cause I don't love like I used to)
Where did time go, I need location
('Cause you don't wanna talk about it, baby)
That's all that I know, I, I, I, I
Where did time go?

[Verse 2]
But now, movin' on, but how?
Uh, somethin' put my feelings in the lost and found
Now I'm stuck forever, and ever, and ever
And ever, and ever, and ever
And ever, and ever
Forever, and ever, and ever
I don't love you no more
Tell me where to go
Can I have my heart back? (Heart back)

[Chorus]
I don't love you anymore
'Cause I don't love you anymore

'Cause I don't love you anymore
But this just might be better for us, you kn-

And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I pick you up in my ride
Make sure you waitin' outside when I pull up
I told my niggas I can't slide (No, no)
Just to be right by your side
I could've been anywhere, but I'm right here

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
You mad or you jealous, you sad or you settle
The brighter the rainbow, the badder the weather
The good with the bad, but the badder the better
Bring my sand to the beach, nigga, and to the desert
We fell from the heavens, we landed like feathers
The rose in the rubble, keep your nose out our petals
Your hoes know my schedule, and my hoes know I'm special
They know not to question, bitch, you know I'm not Alexa
She, she post a pic of me and her from off her iPad
You know them hoes don't like that, where the likes at?
Jealousy is a disease, you can die mad
Tunechi, Sean, CB, Khaled, hi there (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether (Together)

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Dawg, it's these jealous ass hoes I can't relate to
The type to follow you but hardly follow through
You say I'm on your mind, I'm wondering why I'm not on you
Girl, you're fresh out the shower
Towel around your head like you're Erykah Badu
It's lookin' like a spa day
I rearrange your chakras, listenin' to Sade
Let's take a road trip and get high on the highway (Swerve, swerve)
Migrate, spend time, lay back, watch the sky change, woah
And I hear the jealousy, but look, I never listen
The quickest way to let something die is lack of attention (Straight up)
And you got it all, you looking good as my intentions (Damn)
We on an ascension, straight up

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & DJ Khaled]
But girl, I can tell you need some love in your life (Let's ride)
And I'm the one, don't let no one change your mind (Oh)
Fuck what they say (Fuck 'em)

Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether

Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Woah)
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether (Woah)
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Jealous)
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether (Together)

[Bridge: Chris Brown & DJ Khaled]
These boys scared I'ma take they chick (They chick)
Must be the money, 'cause a young boy rich (Real rich)
You could drop a dime, but I make it make sense
Girl, you coming home with me
You the last number on my call list (Call list)
Pull up on me, girl, let's get lit (Get lit)
I think I hit a lick
I think I hit a lick, yeah (Another one)

Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Jealous, let's go)
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether (No, they don't want us)
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Jealous)
Don't want us together, 'gether, 'gether (Together)
Girl, they just jealous, jealous, jealous (Oh, no, they don't)

Unsainted by Slipknot

[Intro]
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go
(I'll never kill myself to save my soul)
I'm finally holding on to letting go
(I didn't come this far to sink so low)
I'm finally holding on to letting go

[Verse 1]
I'm just weathering a rough patch
Another villain with an itch to scratch
Denial is the darkest when you live in a hole
Why does the hell make you feel so cold?
Make a move and you pay for it
Pick a lord and you pray to it
You're so demanding when you want the truth
But your stories don't read for me

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

[Verse 2]
Indecision overload
Keep a buckle on the devil and your eyes on the road
Reaching out for the hand of God
But did you think you'd shake your own?
This killing field is all grown over
The motherfucker wants it wild
Go sow your oats in alphabetical order
The anti-antagonist is back in style
Myopic, cannot see straight
Dystopic, one sin too late
You gotta lie if you wanna believe
But your bibles don't work on me

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting
Go

[Bridge]
Did you think you could win? And fill me in?
Did you think you could do it again? I'm not your sin
I was all that you wanted and more, but you didn't want me
I was more than you thought I could be
So I'm setting you free, I'm setting you free
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me
You've killed the saint in me

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul
I was gone, but how was I to know?
I didn't come this far to sink so low
I'm finally holding on to letting go

[Outro]
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me?
You've killed the saint in me
How dare you martyr me?

The Search by NF

[Verse]
"Hey, Nate, how's life?"
I don t know, it's alright
I've been dealin  with some things like every human being
And really didn't sleep much last night
"I'm sorry," that's fine
I just think I need a little me time
I just think I need a little free time
Little break from the shows and the bus rides, yeah
Last year I had a breakdown
Thoughts tellin' me I'm lost gettin' too loud
Had to see a therapist, then I found out
Somethin' funny s goin  on up in my house
Yeah, I started thinkin' maybe I should move out
You know, pack my cart, take a new route
Clean up my yard, get the noose out
Hang up my heart, let it air out
I ve been searchin'
"What does that mean, Nate?" I've been learning
Grabbin' my keepsakes, leavin  my burdens
Well, I brought a few with me, I'm not perfect
Lookin' at the view, like this concerns me
Pickin' up the cues, right? I'm quite nervous
Hate it when I lose sight, life gets blurry
And things might hurt me
It's prolly gonna be a long journey, but hey
It's worth it, though
Cold world out there, kids, grab your coats
It's been a minute, I know, now I'm back to roam
Lookin' for the antidote to crack the code
Pretty vivid; I admit it, I'm in classic mode
Don't need pity given to me, but I can't condone
Talkin' down to me, I'ma have to crack your nose for crackin' jokes
I'm lookin' for the map to hope, you seen it?
Been makin' a whole lot of changes
Wrote a song about that, you should play it
I get scared when I walk on these stages
I look at the crowd and see so many faces, yeah
That's when I start to get anxious
That's when my thoughts can be dangerous
That's when I put on my makeup and drown in self-hatred
Forget what I'm saying, and 
Where'd the beat go?
Oh, ain't that somethin'?
Drums came in, you ain't see that comin'
Hands on my head, can't tell me nothin'
Got a taste of the fame, had to pump my stomach
Throw it back up like I don't want it
Wipe my face, clean off my vomit
OCD, tryna push my buttons
I said don't touch it, now y'all done it
I can be critical, never typical
Intricate with every syllable, I'm a criminal
Intimate, but never political, pretty visual
Even if you hate it, I'll make it feel like you're in it, though
You call me what you wanna, but never call me forgettable
Leave you deep in thought, I could never swim in the kiddie pool
Way that I been thinkin' is cinematic, it's beautiful
Man, I don't know if I'm makin' movies or music videos (Videos, videos)
Yeah, the sales can rise
Doesn't mean much though when your health declines
See, we've all got somethin' that we trapped inside
That we try to suffocate, you know, hopin' it dies
Try to hold it underwater but it always survives
Then it comes up out of nowhere like an evil surprise
Then it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies
You don't relate to that? Must not be as crazy as I am
The point I'm makin' is the mind is a powerful place
And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way
It's pretty cool, right? Yeah, but it's not always safe
Just hang with me, this'll only take a moment, okay?
Just think about it for a second, if you look at your face
Every day when you get up and think you'll never be great
You'll never be great not because you're not, but the hate
Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith (Woo)
I've been developin', take a look at the benefits
Nothin' to meddle with, I can never be delicate
Am I even relevant? That depends how you measure it
Take a measurement, then bag it up and give me the evidence
Pretty evident; dependable can never be tentative
I'm a gentleman, depending on if I think you're genuine
Pretty elegant, but not afraid to tell you to get a grip
Proper etiquette, I keep it to myself when I celebrate, ah
It's that time again
Better grab your balloons and invite your friends
Seatbelts back on, yeah, strap 'em in
Look at me, everybody, I'm smilin' big
On a road right now that I can't predict
Tell me "Tone that down," but I can't resist
Y'all know that sound, better raise your fist
The search begins, I'm back, so enjoy the trip, huh

[Chorus]
I'm a little drunk, I know it
I ma get high as hell
I'm a little bit unholy
So what? So is everyone else
I'm a little drunk, I know it

I'm a little bit unholy
So what? So is everyone else

Wake up in the middle of a breakdown, yeah, uh
Have sex on the table with the takeout (Uh)
I'm sick of the faking, the using, the taking
The people calling me obscene
You hate me, you love me, you just wanna touch me
I'm only trying to get some peace
So let me do me

[Chorus]
I'm a little drunk, I know it
I'ma get high as hell
I'm a little bit unholy
So what? So is everyone else (Hey)
I'm a little drunk, I know it
I ma get high as hell
I m a little bit unholy
So what? So is everyone else

[Post-Chorus]
So what? So is everyone else
So what? So is everyone else

[Chorus]
I'm a little drunk, I know it
I ma get high as hell
I'm a little bit unholy
So what? So is everyone else

[Post-Chorus]
So what? So is everyone else
So what? So is everyone else
Yeah

D.R.E.A.M. (feat. Ghostface Killah) by Miley Cyrus

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
You're in my bed uninvited
It's fine 'cause I'm in the mood
Hope you don't mind if I spike it
We'll drink it, just me and you

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
And you know we're gonna be alright
We'll be sleeping on a red-eye flight
Keep up with me 'til the end of the night
And we're just gettin' started

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Always last to leave the party
Drugs rule everything around me
Wake up with new tattoos on my body
Drugs rule everything around me
Hit the Goose, raise a toast, pop the molly
I can go toe-to-toe, like I'm Ali
We're all tryna fill the lonely
Drugs rule everything around me

[Post-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus]
These planes are all UFOs
And this city's in outer space
It's better than where we came from
I think that we both should stay

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
'Cause you know we're gonna be alright
We'll be fucking on a red-eye flight
Keep up with me 'til the end of the night
And we're just gettin' started

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Always last to leave the party
Drugs rule everything around me
Wake up with new tattoos on my body
Drugs rule everything around me
Hit the ghost, raise a toast, pop the molly
All the girls in my room look like Dolly
We're all tryna fill the lonely
Drugs rule everything around me

[Post-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
(Drugs rule everything around me)
Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me
Drugs rule everything around me

[Outro: Ghostface Killah]
Drugs rule everything around me
You could call me a king
I got it all in my store, you should crown me
Purple Perc, sticky green mollies, sippy lean
Got the white that's sure to light the floor like in "Billie Jean"
Scarface nights (Nights)
500 thousand on the pinkie, Broadway ice (Ice)
We throw diamonds at weddings and y'all throw rice (Rice)
Lollapalooza, Coachella custies, that's my type
Party all night

And my diamonds so loud, baguettes sing like Adele
Got your hooker on the sale, think I'm pimpin' for real
And these bitches love me, 'cause I ain't kissin' and tell
If I ever make a wish, I ain't wishin' 'em well
Sold your soul for some clout, you ain't never gon' sell

You know I've been searchin' for someone
I've been lookin', hah, for the perfect one
Who could share that special love with me

Rocket Man (I Think It's Going To Be A Long, Long Time) by Elton John

[Verse 1]
She packed my bags last night, pre-flight
Zero hour: 9:00 a.m
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight

[Chorus]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone

[Verse 2]
Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact, it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them if you did
And all this science I don't understand
It's just my job five days a week
A rocket man
A rocket man

[Chorus]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone

[Outro]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time

Must've done something right 'cause all these
Lights are green, man, they look like palm trees

Sittin' there, winning like it's Game of Thrones
And now that we've made it, how complicated was last year?

Heart Upon My Sleeve (feat. Imagine Dragons) by Avicii

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
With my heart upon my sleeve
My head down low, I still feel broken
Down upon my knees
With my head down low and I still feel broken
Where are you? Where are you?
Oh, now that I need you most and
A heart upon my sleeve, broken down, woah

Bad Reputation (feat. Joe Janiak) by Avicii

[Verse 1]
Can you see my emotion
Sinking away in slow motion?
Like a break in the ocean
Just getting lost out at sea
Can you see my emotion
Say, can you see my devotion?
Like a break in the ocean
Just getting lost out at sea

[Chorus]
I hear what you're saying, I got a bad reputation
And now you got me praying for a better situation
Feeling like I'm down, d-down, d-down low
Feeling like I'm down, d-down, d-down low
Guess it's gonna follow me wherever I go
Guess it's gonna follow me, follow me, I know
I got a bad reputation

[Verse 2]
I know that you've been talking
You never see me sleepwalking
Drifting out into nothing
Rolling away in my dreams
Can you feel that I'm falling?
Laying awake till the morning
Every word that I'm calling
Just getting lost out at sea

[Chorus]
I hear what you're saying, I got a bad reputation
And now you got me praying for a better situation
Feeling like I'm down, d-down, d-down low
Feeling like I'm down, d-down, d-down low
Guess it's gonna follow me wherever I go
Guess it's gonna follow me, follow me, I know
I got a bad reputation
I got a bad reputation

So, you got me figured out
Know what I'm all about
I'm all about dollars and green
Don't care about nothing but me
You got me figured out
You know what I'm all about
Don't care about nothing but me, yeah

[Chorus]
I hear what you're saying, I got a bad reputation
And now you got me praying for a better situation

Feeling like I'm down, d-down, d-down low
Guess it's gonna follow me wherever I go
Guess it's gonna follow me, follow me, I know
I got a bad reputation

Hold The Line (feat. A R I Z O N A) by Avicii

[Verse 1]
Crossbows and arrows, the smoke in the shadows
You'll lose your mind standing on the battle line
Starting to choke on your heart in your throat and
It feels just like you can't remember how to fight

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll crack before we shatter
We can't fall apart (Oh, oh)

[Chorus]
We don't get to die young
Trouble keeping our head sometimes
We just have to push on
We don't get to give up this life
All the breath in your lungs
Is stronger than the tears in your eyes
It's do or die, but we're alive
And while we're here, we'll hold the line

[Post-Chorus]
We'll hold the line

[Verse 2]
Don't hold your hands up, it's your final stand
Put your white flag down, oh don't you surrender now
No hero's story, there's no blaze of glory
But dawn only comes at the end of the night

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll crack before we shatter
We can't fall apart (Oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
We don't get to die young
Trouble keeping our head sometimes
We just have to push on
We don't get to give up this life
All the breath in your lungs
Is stronger than the tears in your eyes
It's do or die, but we're alive
And while we're here, we'll hold the line

[Post-Chorus]
Hold the line
Hold the line

[Outro]
We don't get to die young
We just have to push on
We don't get to die young
Hold the line

[Verse]
Look at my history
I'm tryna see what's different from that guy and the richer me
The only thing I see is custom owls from Tiffany
And some gunnas that'll hit you outta nowhere like epiphany
Really, that's it to me
Aside from the obvious, man, it changes in scenery
Testin' me gon' have my niggas testin' machinery
They say that they happy, my man, that's not how they seem to be
The boy, he wild and peaceful, rest in peace Teena Marie
Ethics and values, mob traditions, old fashioned
Monopoly action
Bronny buyin' up Brentwood like he still in Akron
A lot of pain, a lot of passion
A lot of relaxin' while other niggas is overreactin'
That's how we continue down the path of Jordan and Jackson
That's some insight for y'all even if no one's askin'
Last year, niggas really feel like they rode on me
Last year, niggas got hot 'cause they told on me
I'm 'bout to call the bluff of anybody that fold on me
I'm buyin' the buildin' of every door that closed on me
Yeah, Loro Piana and Brioni, the one and only
Champagne popper, the love doctor
Your baby mother call me when she lonely
My tailor see me twice a week, he like my homie
Forever grateful, forever thankful
Diamond necklace, but she wears it on her ankle
The bitch is trendy
My enemies send each other the texts that they could never send me
I'm bankin' two million a show for the residency
Nevada gaming commission in a frenzy
How much money can this casino lend me?
Rippin' markers up over shots of the Henny
Vivid memory, can someone send me a real nigga interlude?
To me, Benihana is pigeon food
This not a forgivin' mood
So much, we gotta count the 20s up in a different room
I am just a body that my brothers are livin' through
Keepin' my connections strictly physical
Everyone that's married is miserable
I know that that is not a lifestyle I can give into
The rise to the top of this mountain has been biblical
I don't carry cash 'cause the money is digital
It's the American Expresser, the debt collector
Hailin' all the way from the Mecca
Got something for Trudy and Rebecca
This shit could last forever
The mind controller, the Ayatollah
I built a bridge to success and had visions of me ridin' over
Step in the room and October gets a lot closer
Haunted houses
I don't know how to count in thousands, only millions
Now tell your friends I'm not the villain
Send 'em to Lagos or Turks and Caicos
Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago
Never go the same places they go
Separate vacations
A far cry from when Drizzy had slept in the basement
I was never on the path to get into Cambridge
I mean, I was good at doin' math, but I'm better with language
Borderline dangerous, approach with caution
I plan to buy your most personal belongings when they up for auction
Man, truth be told, I think about it often
The petty king, the overseer of many things
I wish that I was playin' in a sport where we were gettin' rings
I wouldn't have space on either hand for anything
West Hollywood, know my presence is menacing
Cosa Nostra, shady dealings
Racketeering, the syndicate got they hand in plenty things
The things that we've done to protect the name are unsettling
But no regrets, though, the name'll echo
Years later, none greater
Death to a coward and a traitor, that's just in my nature, yeah

Down Bad (feat. JID, Bas, J. Cole, EARTHGANG & Young Nudy) by Dreamville

[Intro: Young Nudy]
Tell 'em, slime

[Verse 1: Young Nudy]
Yeah, I am the king of the E.A. 
Get this bitch screwed like the DJ (Big slime)
Yeah, I am the shit where we play
We got the chalk where we play (Okay)
Yeah, come through the city
We gon  chop your ass up just like some sushi (Yeah)
AK-47, stick go stupid (Yeah)
Draw the money out, all the way...

[Verse 2: JID]
Okay, lil' dirty, nappy-headed East Atlanta nigga
Father said that I was a force
.44, Hank Aaron chrome
Wanna make it home? Then get out the Porsche
Let a nigga cover FADER 'fore I have to fade a nigga at the FADER Fort
It s tomato or tomato, either way, the boy the greatest
Play it, I won't say it no more
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown
Board of Education vs. Brown
I was bored of education, left the town
Fuck a résumé and fuck a cap and gown
Fuck a background check back 'round when I get the check
Nigga, that's now

[Chorus: JID]
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown (Oh, shit)
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown, crown, crown

[Verse 3: Bas]
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
Picked up the pad, picked up the slack
Pick of the litter, don't litter no bag
Bassy been pickin  up racks, raps comin  clearer than Acuvue 2
And I'm back in the booth
Got  em hackin' a Shaq 'cause they lackin' the juice
Niggas droppin  the ball, they on Shaqtin' a Fool
Actavis drool down the side of yo face
We ain't jackin' it, we ain't dappin' them fools
Get a napkin, you dudes is embarassin'
Who going crazy like us? No comparison
Dreamville like Marion Jones on the steroids
Y'all niggas slow as a heroin high
Y'all had a year, y'all had a year
Y'all had a year, but you let it go by
Yee

[Chorus: JID]
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown (Oh, shit)
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown, crown, crown

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Dreamville head honcho
Bitch, we came from nothin' just like the big bang theory
That poverty stains kept the pain buried
And covered the shame with a dream
We would have fortune and fame
A mil' in the bank, chameleon paint turned cranberry
Now little Jermaine got the same story
As that boy out of St. Vincent-St. Mary: G.O.A.T. 
All hail King Cole, first of his name, long may he reign
The boy got the throne, but you know it ain't a game
Ville nigga, I was born in the same
Pressure cooker that's been known to bust a lump of coal and make a diamond
Two six, we enrolled in Reaganomics
Crew sick, we the Golden State of rhyming, on God

[Verse 5: Johnny Venus]
You could die today, so be hell to pay
I'm a livin', breathin', schemin' testimony
So don't test me, homie, put that in ya, homie
Put a foot up that ass, you a steppin' stone
All my niggas ain't gettin' no sleep
All of my niggas be chasin' their dreams
Ooh, I'm a force of nature, I can't wait to date ya
I was havin' problems 'til I had to break through
All my tattoos for sure, they ain't never for show
Might get tattoo'd on tour, tell ya ho get the door
Spend my time makin' love to your thoughts
Gon' get in line, baby, slut up your mind
It's a brand new season, I'm a righteous heathen
I take on the challenge and I leave it bleedin'
I was down bad, now I'm even Steven
And I'm leavin', leavin' every fuckin' weekend (Oh)

[Chorus: JID]
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown (Oh, shit)
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown, crown, crown

Sad Song (feat. TINI) by Alesso

[Verse 1]
I'll go to the moon just to get close to you
But sitting in your room, I feel so far, far, far away
You know what to do to pull me into you
 Cause every time you move, you take my breath, breath, breath away

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I hear you, oh
Suddenly off my feet
So will you come through? Oh
And I'll play you on repeat, ooh

[Chorus]
You're singing a sad song, but you make it sound happy
You got the perfect words to hurt me so, hurt me so good
You re singing a sad song, but you make it sound happy
You're playing my heart and I'm falling apart just like I knew I would

[Verse 2]
Tell me why I save every last dance for you
And everything you say, I memori-i-ize it all
You know how to get me higher even when I wanna cry
But you're setting me on fire just to warm, warm, warm you up

[Pre-Chorus]
And when I hear you, oh
Suddenly off my feet
So will you come through? Oh
And I'll play you on repeat, ooh

[Chorus]
You're singing a sad song but you make it sound happy
You got the perfect words to hurt me so, hurt me so good
You're singing a sad song but you make it sound happy
You're playing my heart and I m falling apart just like I knew I would

[Post-Chorus]
Everything about you kinda makes it sound happy
How many words for you to hurt me so, hurt me so good
Everything about you kinda makes it sound happy
I m falling apart just, falling apart just like I knew you would

[Bridge]
Hear you deep inside of me
Your back and forth is slowly killing me
Don't just leave me quietly
Play your song and keep convincing me

[Chorus]
You re singing a sad song but you make it sound happy
You got the perfect words to hurt me so, hurt me so good
You're singing a sad song but you make it sound happy
You're playing my heart and I'm falling apart just like I knew I would

Lalala by Y2K

[Intro: bbno$ & Y2K]
Did I really just forget that melody?
Naw, na, na, banananananana
Alright, dada dadadada

[Chorus: bbno$]
When I popped off, then your girl gave me just a little bit of lockjaw
Baby so cold, he from the north, he from the Canada
Bankroll so low, I got nothing else that I can withdraw
Ran out the door
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing like lalala, lalala
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing like lalala, lalala
How I stride like that

[Verse 1: bbno$]
Amex, no cap, eight hundred score
They wonder how, how I guap like that
I rap my lyrics when I perform
They wonder how, how I stride like that
Married to the grind, I brought my ring
I'm corny, but your girly want the dick
Modest with my jewels, but check the bank
Finally got the money, say my thanks

[Chorus: bbno$]
When I popped off, then your girl gave me just a little bit of lockjaw
Baby so cold, he from the north, he from the Canada
Bankroll so low, I got nothing else that I can withdraw
Ran out the door
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing like lalala, lalala
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing like lalala, lalala
How I stride like that

[Verse 2: bbno$]
Haha, I'm at the bank again
They wonder how, how I guap like that
Pink whip with flames all on the side
They wonder how, how I stride like that
Got that Gucci on my body, now she tryna pipe me, woo
Popped a Lucy Loosey Goosey, sussy boy, I keep you cool
Got the paper, went to school
Be careful who you callin' a fool
Ayy, ha, ayy

[Chorus: bbno$]
When I popped off, then your girl gave me just a little bit of lockjaw
Baby so cold, he from the north, he from the Canada
Bankroll so low, I got nothing else that I can withdraw
Ran out the door

I got your bitch singing like lalala, lalala
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing like lalala, lalala
How I stride like that

From the breaking of the day to the middle of night
From the breaking of the day to the middle of night
From the breaking of the day to the middle of night
From the breaking of the day to the middle of night

[Verse 1]
Summertime and I'm caught in the feeling
Getting high and I'm up on the ceiling
I don't know what you're doing in New York
All I know is you ain't on my bedroom floor

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm seein' you undressed in my room
But it's just a memory, a fantasy
Are you in your house? Are you going out?
Are you going crazy like me?
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night

[Chorus]
I try to forget about you, baby
And I die when I think of you with someone else and
I don't know why, I don't know why you're dancing in my mind
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night
All the time
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night
All the time

[Verse 2]
Everyone's been wearing your perfume
Everything is reminding me of you
I don't know what I'm doing in New York
But all I know is you ain't walking through the door

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm seein' you undressed in my room
But it's just a memory, a fantasy
Are you in your house? Are you going out?
Are you going crazy like me?
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night

[Chorus]
I try to forget about you, baby
And I die when I think of you with someone else and
I don't know why, I don't know why you're dancing in my mind
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night
I try to forget about you, baby
And I die when I think of you with someone else and
I don't know why, I don't know why you're dancing in my mind
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night (Yeah)

[Bridge]
And I wonder if you think about me, too
Where we used to go, what we used to do
And I wonder if you're crying out inside, oh yeah
(From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night)
(From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night)
Oh whoa
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night

[Chorus]
I try to forget about you, baby (I try)
And I die when I think of you with someone else and
I don't know why (I don't know why)
I don't know why you're dancing in my mind (Yeah)
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night
I try to forget about you, baby (Baby, baby)
And I die when I think of you with someone else and
I don't know why, I don't know why you're dancing in my mind
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night
All the time
From the breaking of the day to the middle of the night
All the time

Out The Mud by Lil Baby

[Intro: Future]
Cook that shit up, Quay
Lil Baby
I've been riding around, yeah, hundred times around

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I been riding 'round in rental cars, tryna lay low
I'm a real soldier, boy, I really play with Dracos
Took the whole gang from out the hood and put 'em on the payroll
Having flashbacks of hittin' the red with the Karo
She just had a baby for me, so I paid to get her makeover
I was being calm, it's like it's they beg for me to take over
180 on the Range Rover, 400 on a Rolls truck (Wow)
300 on a G-Wagen (Wow), I'm a big dawg, you can add it up
Something wrong with him, he ain't addin' up
We laugh at them, they mad at us
It's a home run, I'm batter up
My earrings like baseballs
Clout chasers, I hate y'all
I don't see people like Ray Charles
Where I'm from, we don't do fraud
You a kingpin or a takegod?

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Future]
I just bought a bustdown, can't wait to hold it up
All these Percs won't stay down, I keep on throwing up
Youngin ain't gon' play with him, he did it off of love (Yeah)
I feel like it's different when you got it out the mud
I just bought a bustdown, can't wait to hold it up (Yeah)
All these Percs won't stay down, I keep on throwing up (Yeah)
Youngin ain't gon' play with him, he did it off of love (Racks)
I feel like it's different when you got it out the mud

[Verse 2: Future]
Who you know, nigga? Street niggas call me Pluto
Really I'm a trap nigga, I can wrap a kilo (Yeah)
Sippin' sizzurp took me number one, no promo (Oh yeah)
I'm in spaceships, I'm in Mars on the low-low (Yeah, yeah)
I'm in the Phantom with the stars, feel like Fabo (Yeah)
I got million dollar stars on my payroll, huh
I feel like you different once you make it out the mud
Got a brand new Richard, I can't wait to hold it up
VV, cut it up, got all new baguettes in it, cut it up (Ooh)
One, brrt, call, that's all, brrt, pu-pullin' up (Ooh)
This bag make a bad, bad bitch call up and quit her job (Yeah)
Where I'm from you either gotta murder, if you make it out, you a god

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I just bought a bustdown, can't wait to hold it up
All these Percs won't stay down, I keep on throwing up
Youngin ain't gon' play with him, he did it off of love (Yeah)
I feel like it's different when you got it out the mud
I just bought a bustdown, can't wait to hold it up (Yeah)
All these Percs won't stay down, I keep on throwing up (Yeah)
Youngin ain't gon' play with him, he did it off of love
I feel like it's different when you got it out the mud

[Outro: Future]
Out the mud
I feel like you different when you get it out the mud
Youngin ain't gon' play with him, he did it off of love
I just bought a bustdown, can't wait to hold it up

When I Grow Up by NF

[Verse 1]
Yeah, when I grow up, you know what I wanna be?
Take a seat, let me tell you my ridiculous dreams
I wanna rap, yeah, I know it's hard to believe
And I can tell you're already thinkin' I will never succeed
But I'm okay with it, I admit the lyrics are weak
I've been workin' on 'em, I'll be good eventually
I understand you gotta crawl before you get to your feet
But I been running for a while, they ain't ready for me, ahh
I know this prolly isn't really realistic
And honestly, I might not ever make a difference
But that don't make a difference, I'ma have to risk it
I've been crunchin' numbers, you ain't gotta be a mathematician
To see the odds ain't rootin' for me
I can't lie though, it's kinda how I like it to be
The underdog, yeah, you prolly think you know what I mean
But what I'm saying is they ever push me, I'm gonna swing, yeah
I could go to college, get in debt like everybody else
Graduate and prolly get a job that doesn't pay the bills
That don't make a lot of sense to me, forget the Happy Meals
I don't like the dollar menu, I would rather make a meal
Huh? Make a mil'? Nah, I said make a meal
Home-cookin', get the grill, how you want it? Pretty well?
Everything I see is overdone to me, I'm not Adele
But I'ma get a record deal and say hello to mass appeal

[Chorus]
When I grow up, I just want to pay my bills
Rappin' about the way I feel (Oh, yeah)
I just want to make a couple mil'
Leave it to the fam in the will (Oh, yeah)
I just want to sign a record deal
Maybe buy a house up in the hills (Oh, yeah)
Might not be the best in my field
But I guarantee that I'ma die real
When I grow up

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, ayy
When I grow up
Yeah, yeah, ayy

[Verse 2]
I'ma make 'em notice me, rhymin' like it's poetry
Everything I oversee, I just like to overthink
Mockin' me, you pay the fee, no return and no receipts
Those of you that don't believe, quiet, you don't know a thing
Quiet when I'm tryna sing, quiet when I'm making beats
Quiet when I'm tryna think, sorry, I don't mean to scream
I just feel like no one really gets me and it's sad to see
'Cause someday I'ma grow up and show all of you it's meant to be (Yeah)
Anybody wanna hear me rap? "No"
Come on, let me play a couple tracks, "No"
Come on, I can spit it really fast, "No"
You think I should throw this in the trash? "No"
Tricked ya; haters, go away before I hit ya
I am not a beggar or a kiss-up
You don't understand? Well, I forgive ya
I am not a quitter, you ain't really think that, did ya?
Maybe someday I could even be up on the radio
Have a tour bus and maybe even play a couple shows
Everybody in the crowd singing every word I wrote
Tellin' me that I am not the only one that feels alone
Huh? You feel alone? Yeah, I kinda feel alone
Wonder if that feelin' ever goes away when you get old
Will I ever make it as an artist? I don't really know
Might not make a lot of dough
I'ma have to try it, though

[Chorus]
When I grow up
I just wanna pay my bills
Rappin' about the way I feel (Oh, yeah)
I just wanna make a couple mil'
Leave it to the fam in the will (Oh, yeah)
(Leave it to the fam in the will)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I just wanna sign a record deal
Maybe buy a house up in the hills (Okay, oh, yeah)
Might not be the best in my field (Ayy, ayy, yeah)
But I guarantee that I'ma die real
When I grow up
I just wanna pay my bills (Woo)
Rappin' about the way I feel (Oh, yeah)
(Yeah, the way I feel)
Yeah, I just wanna make a couple mil' (Ayy, couple mil')
Leave it to the fam in the will (Oh, yeah, to the fam in the will)
I just wanna sign a record deal (Woo)
Maybe buy a house up in the hills (Oh, yeah)
(House up in the hills)
Yeah, I might not be the best in my field
But I guarantee that I'ma die real
When I grow up
When I grow up

Best Part of Me (feat. YEBBA) by Ed Sheeran

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight, day to day, it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded, too

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell does she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran with YEBBA]
Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you

[Verse 2: YEBBA]
I overthink and still forget
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time
Always 30 minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet

[Pre-Chorus: YEBBA]
But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah, yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & YEBBA]
'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you
Oh, lately, everything's making sense, too
Baby, I'm so in love with you

[Bridge: YEBBA]
With you
Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum

[Chorus: Both, Ed Sheeran, & YEBBA]
Baby, the best part of me is you (Whoa)
Lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you (Oh)
Baby, I'm so in love with you (Yeah, yeah)
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you

Under The Sun (with J. Cole & Lute feat. DaBaby) by Dreamville

[Intro: J. Cole]
If you miss me
And you can't find
Me nowhere
I done seen it all, oh my God
Uh
I done seen it all, oh my God, I swear

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Nothing new under the sun, nobody fucking with son
I got a couple of sons, a couple of guns
A couple of niggas that bust up the party and fuck up the fun
She digging me and I m cuffing her friend
She ig'-ing you while we fucking for fun
I got her suckin' her thumb, that s my lil' baby
She call me daddy like grandmama baby
If this Sunday dinner, my hand on her gravy
I been on the craziest wave, if I'm on the stage
An M is my minimum wage
This ain't no kennel, behave
Niggas is with all that barking, we send 'em a stray
So in a way we the dogcatchers
How many bullets your dawg catchin'?
Sawed-off, raw dog fashion
Hauled off, hope God catch him, damn

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch
Too many opps in here, tell me who you with, ayy

[Verse 2: Lute]
Potato over my gun
I move in silence 'cause niggas be clocking my funds
When they should keep eye on they bitch  cause baby girl coming with son
Niggas be judging my moves, but please tell me, what have you done?
My cousin might air out the party for fun
Pistol grips get to squeezing
Wish a nigga would like Liam Neeson
I don t even need a reason, loyalty over treason
Bitch nigga, come and see me
Put some respect on my name
What side of my city I claim
I try to stay in my lane
Took my advance and put a Caprice on them thangs
I'm Beatties Ford  til the wheels fall
Know some niggas probably pissed off
Who would thought I made it this far?
Gold Mouf, bitch, fuck 'em all

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch
Too many opps in here, tell me who you with

[Verse 3: DaBaby]
I just put diamonds on all of my teeth, now they probably think I ain't intelligent
In the homicide unit interrogation, asking questions, you know I ain t tell 'em shit
Bitches call me a jock, all-American
I'm at the top of my class with my lettermen
I remember back in college, bitches knocking on my dorm door
I ain't never let 'em in
Now you know that that's cap, know I hit a few
Ain't no job, I'm selling gas like I'm Jiffy Lube
I had a freak, used to fuck while her boyfriend in class
I hit her from the back from like 10 to 2
No back and forth with these rappers
They mention me, dissin' me
No talkin' back, I won't mention you
Watch, when I come put that iron on your ass and I dip
They gon' want me to snitch in my interviews
I'm on fire, bitch, I'm lit, but I'm really cool
Don't acknowledge the shrimps when they ridicule
They don't come out after dark, bitch, I swim with the sharks
You ain't got enough heart, get a bigger pool
Wanna fight but he bigger, I ain't really trippin'
Reach under my shirt, grab a bigger tool
I got a Glock with a dick, let's get physical
They gon' be hollerin' out, "Rip," and they missin' you
They got me started, I might as well finish it (Talk your shit, nigga)
I'm from Charlotte, you know how these niggas do
Baby

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch
Too many opps in here, tell me who you with

[Verse 2: JID]
Okay, lil' dirty, nappy-headed East Atlanta nigga
Father said that I was a force
.44, Hank Aaron chrome
Wanna make it home? Then get out the Porsche
Let a nigga cover FADER 'fore I have to fade a nigga at the FADER Fort
It s tomato or tomato, either way, the boy the greatest
Play it, I won't say it no more
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown
Board of Education vs. Brown
I was bored of education, left the town
Fuck a résumé and fuck a cap and gown
Fuck a background check back 'round when I get the check
Nigga, that's now

[Chorus: JID]
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown (Oh, shit)
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown, crown, crown

[Verse 3: Bas]
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
Picked up the pad, picked up the slack
Pick of the litter, don't litter no bag
Bassy been pickin  up racks, raps comin  clearer than Acuvue 2
And I'm back in the booth
Got  em hackin' a Shaq 'cause they lackin' the juice
Niggas droppin  the ball, they on Shaqtin' a Fool
Actavis drool down the side of yo face
We ain't jackin' it, we ain't dappin' them fools
Get a napkin, you dudes is embarassin'
Who going crazy like us? No comparison
Dreamville like Marion Jones on the steroids
Y'all niggas slow as a heroin high
Y'all had a year, y'all had a year
Y'all had a year, but you let it go by
Yee

[Chorus: JID]
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown (Oh, shit)
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown, crown, crown

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
Dreamville head honcho
Bitch, we came from nothin' just like the big bang theory
That poverty stains kept the pain buried
And covered the shame with a dream
We would have fortune and fame
A mil' in the bank, chameleon paint turned cranberry
Now little Jermaine got the same story
As that boy out of St. Vincent-St. Mary: G.O.A.T. 
All hail King Cole, first of his name, long may he reign
The boy got the throne, but you know it ain't a game
Ville nigga, I was born in the same
Pressure cooker that's been known to bust a lump of coal and make a diamond
Two six, we enrolled in Reaganomics
Crew sick, we the Golden State of rhyming, on God

[Verse 5: Johnny Venus]
You could die today, so be hell to pay
I'm a livin', breathin', schemin' testimony
So don't test me, homie, put that in ya, homie
Put a foot up that ass, you a steppin' stone
All my niggas ain't gettin' no sleep
All of my niggas be chasin' their dreams
Ooh, I'm a force of nature, I can't wait to date ya
I was havin' problems 'til I had to break through
All my tattoos for sure, they ain't never for show
Might get tattoo'd on tour, tell ya ho get the door
Spend my time makin' love to your thoughts
Gon' get in line, baby, slut up your mind
It's a brand new season, I'm a righteous heathen
I take on the challenge and I leave it bleedin'
I was down bad, now I'm even Steven
And I'm leavin', leavin' every fuckin' weekend (Oh)

[Chorus: JID]
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown (Oh, shit)
I was just fucked up, I was just down, down bad
I had to tighten the fuck up, but I'm here for the crown, crown, crown, crown

[Chorus]
True say, I want and I need
To let go, use my time to be free
It's like it's always what you like
It's always what you like
Why it's always what you like?
It's always what you like, huh

[Post-Chorus]
Ain't no more actin', man, that forecast say I should just let me grow
No more red light for me, baby, only green, I gotta go
Pack my past up in the back, oh, let my future take ahold
This is what I gotta do, can't be regrettin' when I'm old

[Verse]
Brand new places I'll choose and I'll go, I know
Embracin' this news I behold unfolding
I know, I know, I know it don't feel like it's time
But I look back at this moment, I'll see that I'm fine
I know, I know, I know it don't feel like it's time
I set boundaries for myself, it's time to cross the line

[Chorus]
True say, I want and I need
To let go, use my time to be free
It's like it's always what you like
It's always what you like
Why it's always what you like?
It's always what you like, uh

[Post-Chorus]
Ain't no more actin', man, that forecast say I should just let me grow
No more red light for me, baby, only green, I gotta go
Pack my past up in the back, oh, let my future take ahold
This is what I gotta do, can't be regrettin' when I'm old

Told him to make a new piece out of this
Ever since, I just can't give no fuck 'bout no bitch (It's a check)

Got a lot of bands in Costa Rica
Lot of hoes in Costa Rica, got a passport in my pocket

Forty-five on me, shit hot like a pocket
You ain't talkin' money, it's nonsense
Got your baby mama doing drugs in the moshpit

Jump into the crowd, leave your hand in the sky, babe
No hand, no nothin'
Gotta trust your crowd, gotta land in the cloud, babe
Baby, I got that feel (Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)
I don't know why you're doin' this to me
I tried to tell 'em not to do it this loud
I tried to tell 'em not to bust it out the wrap' 'til we leave
I was thinkin' suicide for the rivals
I done went and bought a car with the title
Told the promoters have her on the rider
Knockin' boots backstage at the Wireless
She contagious like poison ivy

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Young Thug]
Baby, I got the feels, yeah
Say that I'm out my mind, but it's somethin' real
Somethin' real

Used to be Playboy heartbreaker
But for you, I'll travel a thousand acres
When we met, I told her I play for Lakers (Alright)
One day, we'll get married in Las Vegas (Nah)
I'm good for your health, this can't be a sin (Alright)
This love give you protein and vitamin (Yeah)
See you wigglin', jigglin' (Mmm)
If I have a bite, will it taste like cinnamon? (One)
This is one in a million
So I never ever treat you like Billie Jean
Ain't nothin' like anything I ever really seen
And you give me this feel if you know what I mean

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Young Thug]
Baby, I got the feels, yeah (Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing

1000 Nights (feat. Meek Mill & A Boogie Wit da Hoodie) by Ed Sheeran

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
This the type of shit we used to dream of (Yeah, yeah)
Bad bitch look like Mona Lisa (Mona Lisa)
Flippin' off a yacht in Ibiza (Splash, water)
Clear port, hasta la vista
Do it all again when we touchdown, everything bust down
Teacher said I would lose, I be like, "What now?"
I started makin' moves, they showin' me love now
Lit like a light bulb 'cause, bitch, I'm the plug now
And now you know we poppin', we bubble like soda poppin'
I see it, I like it, I wake up, pull up, and go and cop it
The millions get wired, them Benny hunnids still go in pocket
I party with Ed Sheeran, my homies still hold a rocket
'Cause I'm so hood, it don't make no sense
Still remember the times I couldn't pay my rent
Now, I walk in a stadiums, tell 'em, "Play my shit"
And they gon' sing like this

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
Last night, I played a show at a stadium in Atlanta
Husband and wives, daddies and daughters with the cameras
I never thought it would get this big, but why does it matter?
Everything is already part of a plan
I remember, damn, me and my man inside of this Splitter van
200 a night, end of 2010
Stayin' up in every city's Holiday Inn
If it wasn't there, then I was at the couch of a friend's
Wetherspoon's was an easy option to get a cheaper lunch and
2 pint, the waitress maybe leave her number
On to the next town, but now it's to the next continent (Woo)
And I don't think it's gonna be stoppin' anytime soon
Birds eye view, pay my dues for a two-mile queue
Don't need to read reviews if you can't do the things I do
Oh, let me invite you to my world

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded (Gettin' faded)
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights

[Verse 3: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Mmm, I'm so faded, yeah
I don't even know how much I made this year
I'm so used to bein' on some player shit
Cheated on my girlfriend with a famous bitch
Hoodie on pull up, just like the Reaper, yeah
I do this on the regular, make you seem unfair
St. Laurent, Gucci sweater, the red and green Moncler
Me and Meek and Ed Sheeran just like the Beatles, yeah
From her head to her toe, she know she be flee, oh yeah
Everyday, I be seein' her and Ceiline, oh yeah
She wanna come closer, but I don't see us there
I'm not a regular person, I be low-key, oh yeah
From New York out to London
She was, she was with me all the time
And I've been on the road, so long she couldn't call my line
And now she got her ass and titties done for a thousand likes

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights

Way To Break My Heart (feat. Skrillex) by Ed Sheeran

[Verse 1]
Star sign, Gemini
Brown eyes, fair hair in the light
We called time last night
And I can't stop thinkin  'bout her

[Refrain]
And her lips upon mine
So soft, feelings I don't know the name of
Under the clothes we take off
Used to be two hearts in love

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, why, oh why am I alone?
Did I, did I do something wrong?
Am I the reason, or have you found someone else?
So tell me, girl

[Chorus]
How can I live without love?
How can I be what you want?
 Cause when the morning comes around
You're still gone and I'll say
How can I see through the dark?
All I can do is wonder where you are
Are you happy in someone else's arms?
Well, that's the way to break my

[Post-Chorus]
Heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That s the way to break my 

[Verse 2]
First love never dies
Guess I ll see you in another life
12 years down the line
There's just one thing I remember

[Refrain]
Her lips upon mine
So soft, feelings I don t know the name of
Under the clothes we take off
Used to be two hearts in love

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, why, oh why am I alone?
Did I, did I do something wrong?
Am I the reason, or have you found someone else?
So tell me, girl

[Chorus]
How can I live without love?
How can I be what you want?
'Cause when the morning comes around
You're still gone and I'll say
How can I see through the dark?
All I can do is wonder where you are
Are you happy in someone else s arms?
Well, that's the way to break my

[Post-Chorus]
Heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my 

[Outro]
That's the 
That's the 
That's the 
Did I, did I?
That's the 
That's the 
That's the way to break my 

I Don't Want Your Money (feat. H.E.R.) by Ed Sheeran

[Intro: H.E.R.]
Ayy, I waited for you all day

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I been away on the road for a little while
Today, I'm headin' home to make my baby smile
She hates it when I am over a thousand miles
Away, and I'm not there to pick up when she dials, yeah
She's always lookin back, and sayin' "There was a time
When you would be around every single night
Now, I'm not sayin' that I want another guy
But I need you here for the good times and the bad times
Yeah, the pullin' out my hair, gettin' mad times
Not just the when I'm in your bed on my back times
Baby, every time I call, it's a bad time
Just want you here on your own"

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
There ain't no diamonds, silver or gold
That can replace a man's love in the home
And she keeps tellin' me over and over

[Chorus: H.E.R. & Ed Sheeran]
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
I used to be around more, but I was strapped for cash
And that's not attractive, workin' my ass off
Tryna make a success outta myself I guess
I could have been more present, but I was in a mess
I remember bein' on tour, stayin' up on the phone
30 minute conversation, "Boy, when you comin' home?
I can't be buildin' a family life here on my own"
Baby, I'm doin' it for us, so why you takin' that tone?
Like I'm the bad guy
I thought it would have made me better in your dad's eyes
I'm busy stackin' up the paper for the bad times
'Cause, baby, you never know
I'm poppin right now, but there will come a day when I won't

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran & H.E.R.]
There ain't no diamonds, silver or gold
That can replace a man's love in the home (Yeah)
And she keeps tellin' me over and over

[Chorus: H.E.R. & Ed Sheeran]
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time (I want all of your love, your time)
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time (I just want your, I just want your time)

[Bridge: Ed Sheeran & H.E.R.]
You know you're my baby (You know you're my baby)
I'm sorry I been away, yeah, no lie
Boy, you drive me crazy
Why you gotta mess with my mind?
You know you're my baby (You know you're, oh)
I'm sorry I been away, yeah, no lie
Boy, you drive me crazy, you know, you know

[Chorus: H.E.R. & Ed Sheeran]
I don't want your money, baby, oh (I don't want your money)
You know I just want your time (Yeah, I want, yeah, I want your time)
(She say) I don't want your money, baby, oh (I don't want your money)
You know I just want your time (Time, time)

[Outro: H.E.R.]
And I love, and I love, and I love you
Yeah, I love, and I love, and I love you
And I love, and I love, and I love you
But I want your time, yeah
Want your time, time

I'm gonna take my horse to the Seoul town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

Do You Remember by Chance the Rapper

[Chorus: Ben Gibbard]
Do you remember how when you were younger
The  summers all lasted forever?
Days  disappeared into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever

[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
I remember the summer Lil' Chano got ahold of his household
The  same summer that widowed Gwyneth Paltrow
Back  when I could trust in my dogs like Balto
My family The Sopranos, these niggas is altos
First  album, every track could be the outro
Velcro to shelltoes, things that we will outgrow
Used to rock South Pole, summers taking the 6 bus to South Shore
Never sold out but now we out-sold
That  was the summer I learned to love the great outdoors
Learned you get the fans if you can't keep yo' mouth closed
That summer left a couple marks like Groucho
That halo can turn hollow, depending how low
That summer left a couple tan lines
I love my city they let me cut the line on the Dan Ryan
They walk on eggshells and landmines
They communicate with handsigns

[Chorus: Ben Gibbard]
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
I remember the last summer of the teens
I can't recall too many summers in between
Will Smith, Genie, Donald Glover, Lion King
My daughter on the swing like the 2017 Cubs
My daughter mother double-ringed up
Finger look like jean cuffs, or two lean cups
Used to have obsession with the 27 club
Now I'm turning 27, wanna make it to the 2070 club
Put the 27s down, Lord, give me a clean lung
Took the ring up out the box I know this ain't no brief love
This story arc so sharp that it made the streets flood
This the type of covenant you keep love, deep love

[Chorus: Ben Gibbard]
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever

[Outro: Ben Gibbard & Chance the Rapper]
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever? (Summer everlasting)
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever

Leave Me Alone by NF

[Intro]
(Yeah)
Hey!
Leave me alone

[Verse 1]
Panic-stricken, handle business, not a joke, yeah
Manners missin', travel different, no control, yeah
Time to listen, time to zip it, keep it closed
My description, highly gifted, take some notes, yeah
Lack of interest, why'd you visit? Hit the road, yeah
I'm kinda twisted, so keep your distance, be a ghost
Yeah, see I'm inventive, but quite the menace, you ain't know?
Well then I'm offended, let's jog your memories, here we go, yeah
I went from nobody to kinda famous
Hide my plaques inside the closet, I just can't explain it
My wife, she tells me that she's proud and thinks that I should hang 'em
But I just leave 'em on the ground right next to my self-hatred
Yeah, yeah, mental health, where's my mental health?
Diagnosed with OCD, what does that mean? Well, gather 'round
That means I obsessively obsess on things I think about
That means I might take a normal thought and think it's so profound (Leave me alone)
Ruminating, fill balloons up full of doubts
Do the same things, if I don't, I'm overwhelmed (Leave me alone)
Thoughts are pacing, they go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's so draining, let's move onto something else, fine (Oh) (Leave me alone)
Runnin' the game, but they don't even know it
Like I'm undercover and don't wanna blow it
I come out of nowhere, they don't even notice
The flow is so cold, you would think it was snowin' (Oh) (Leave me alone)
I'm under the weather, but wind isn't blowin'
I got an umbrella for difficult moments
You got to admit it, I'm very devoted
I'm out in the rain, but it don't always open, so I  (I, I)

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold up my balloons and cover up my face
I can feel them weighin' on me every day
I should let 'em go and watch 'em float away
But I'm scared if I do, then I'll be more afraid (More afraid)
Tell them how I feel, but they don't wanna change (Don't wanna change)
Tell them how I feel, but they remain the same (Same)
Loosen up my grip, they say that's not okay
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy, leave me alone! (Oh!)

[Chorus]
Ayy, yeah
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone!
Woo, yeah
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone! (Leave me alone)

[Verse 2]
I hate when they debate if we're underrated
We're so overlooked that they're lookin' over our numbers, Nathan (Leave me alone)
We don't do enough interviews or go out in public lately
We don't post enough on our socials
To keep the buzz from fading (Leave me alone)
Let it fade, yeah, let it fade
Once it's decimated, then you drop a song outta nowhere
And all the fans embrace it (Leave me alone)
Then the buzz will surface again, it's part of my operation
I don't need advice from my doubts right now
End of conversation (Leave me alone)
Shut your mouth, yeah, shut your mouth
Better tone it down, close it now
If you make a sound, I'ma change the dial (Leave me alone)
Funny how they be acting loud, comin' unannounced
It's floating 'round
Man, the kid is wild, pretty vile, true (Leave me alone)
I'm kinda funny but don't really show it
I keep it together but have a disorder
I go to my room and I sit in my corner
And talk to myself in a language that's foreign (Leave me alone)
I think of a rhyme and I have to record it
But know if I don't, I'll wake up in the mornin'
And question my life again, always avoiding
I hate to be different, but hate to be normal, so I... (Leave me alone)

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold up my balloons and cover up my face
I can feel them weighin' on me every day
I should let 'em go and watch 'em float away
But I'm scared if I do, then I'll be more afraid
Tell them how I feel, but they don't wanna change (Wanna change)
Tell them how I feel but they remain the same (They remain the same)
Loosen up my grip, they say that's not okay
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy
Leave me alone!

[Chorus]
Ayy, yeah
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone!
Woo, yeah
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone!

[Verse 3]
Remember back in "NO NAME," I said fame called? (Yeah, yeah)
Told you I hung up, it kinda felt wrong (Leave me alone) (Wrong, wrong)
Finally called him back, we didn't talk long (No)
He asked me how I'd been, I sent him this song (Leave me alone, quiet, quiet, quiet)
Yeah, think he took offense, he kinda seemed off (Off)
I texted him that night to ask what he thought (Leave me alone, quiet, quiet, quiet)
It took a couple days to get a response
But once I finally did, he said this song sucks (Leave me alone, quiet, quiet, quiet)
Feel the symptoms, couldn't miss 'em, wrestle with 'em
Then I pin and flip 'em, brought some back up
No, well, you should get some (Leave me alone, quiet, quiet, quiet)
Who you dissin'? Mood is switchin', don't come in the kitchen
You should listen, cookin' record for my hands are blisterin'
So persistent, don't forget this, hold the tension, soul is bendin'
No pretendin', open-ended, low percentage, so demented (Leave me alone)
Whole consensus, flow tremendous, no apprentice, dope incentive
Show intensive, so possessive, tone aggressive, watch your step when I... (Leave me alone)

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold up my balloons and cover up my face (Up my face)
I can feel them weighin' on me every day (Yeah, every day)
I should let 'em go and watch them float away (Yeah, float away)
But I'm scared if I do then I'll be more afraid
Leave me alone (Yeah), leave me alone, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Leave me alone, leave me alone (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Leave me alone, leave me alone (Yeah, leave me alone)
Yeah, leave me alone, leave me alone, ayy, leave me alone!

[Chorus]
Ayy, yeah
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone!
Woo, yeah
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone!
Ayy, yeah
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone!
Woo, yeah
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy
Leave me alone

All Day Long by Chance the Rapper

[Intro: Chance the Rapper]
Yup
And we back (Igh)
Na-na-na (Igh)

[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
If you blink you might miss it
You gotta click it or ticket
You gotta go get to gettin' before it's gone
End it quickly as it begun
Life is short as a midget, but mine's a little LeBron
Been a minute since Eminem was a blonde
I need a peace prize, mom invented the bomb
A nigga wanted more, I would only sit on the lawn
A nigga up next like strongly scented colognes
I'm 'bout to book a show at the Dimmsdale Dimmadome
I still could hit up Sony today and get a loan
And shout out to Miss Sylvia Rhone, we get along
But that boy advance gotta be bigger than Diddy Kong
I need stock and it gotta be Pippi Long
Can't stop, won't stop boppin' like Diddy's song
My next tour got eight legs like daddy long
I'm 'bout to have two kids that like daddy's song

[Chorus: John Legend]
We can't be out here pleasin' everybody (Oh, I...)
We know who we are (Oh, yeah)
And if you with me, then I'm with you darlin' (Yeah)
Baby, all day long (Come on, come on)
Baby, all day long (Oh, I...)
Baby, all day long (Yeah)
Baby, all day long

[Interlude: Chance the Rapper]
This is, this is the day
Took it the scenic route, but this is the way
That's old news, baby, this is today
They gon' miss us today, you a "Mrs." today
This is, this is the day
Took it the scenic route, but this is the way
That's old news, baby, this is today
They gon' miss us today, you a "Mrs." today

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Backyard blasted, dance 'til it's grassless
Patio glass, the mazel tov cocktails
Bomb, b-bombastic, used to drop acid
Marli come soon, I only drop classics
Everyone ask
"When that heat gon' drop?"
"When that knee gon' drop?"
"When is he gon' pop the question we all got?"
"'Cause this could be y'all block
You're livin' in a glass house, we can see y'all clocks"
But I can see you from the other side, see y'all rocks
And we could've been Magneto, if you seen our locks
But we share with the world, not just fans
Come out clean lookin' like we jumped the broom and the dustpan
So now it's here and we actin' out
Dame Dash, champagne in the back of Tao
Now I'm back in my bag and the cat is out
Burn a hole in my pocket like a Black & Mild (Ah)

[Chorus: John Legend]
We can't be out here pleasin' everybody (Oh, I...)
I know, you know, we know just who we are (Oh, yeah)
And if you with me, then I'm with you darlin' (Oh, baby)
Baby, all day long (Come on, come on)
Baby, all day long (Oh, I...)
Baby, all day long (Yeah)
Baby, all day long (Oh, I...)

[Bridge: John Legend]
Hey, we made it, we made it
I'm feelin' grateful
I'm here with my favorite
Oh God, I'm thankful
Our song and we played it
So good, we played it (Yeah)
I just wanted to keep on playin' (Hey)
We made it, we made it
I'm feelin' grateful
I'm here with my favorite
Oh God, I'm thankful
Our song and we played it
So good, we played it (Yeah)

[Chorus: John Legend]
Baby, all day long (Come on, come on)
Baby, all day long (Oh, I...)
Baby, all day long (Yeah)
Baby, all day long
Baby, all day long

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak & YBN Cordae, Both]
Come on, New York City, Come on!
One of y'all, y'all, gon' be messin' with me (Oh, what the-, wha-uh, come on)

Not to mention wealthy, body on her healthy
Young millionaire, what really can you tell me? Smell me?
Boy, that's Chanel cologne
I'm in Europe with the tourists with no cellular phone
She like-

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak and YBN Cordae]
Ooh, sound like rich brother problems (Uh-huh)
I hit a bad chick with a fistful of condoms
And the randomness, like risky ménages
Hit the head right, she can get what she wanted (Uh-huh)
The spits, then flaunt it, my drip like a faucet
She told me she was prego, I ain't even take the mother, mother ____ out my pocket, yeah

[Verse 3: YBN Cordae]
Hold on, the opposite
She want to fly her, so I copped a jet
Must be thinkin' I'm a one-way ticket on a runway
Drippin' in my feng shui, sippin' on a sundae

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak & YBN Cordae, Both]
One of y'all, y'all, gon' be messin' with me (Mmm)
I got two bad broads gon' be rubbin' my feet (Oh, what the-,  uh, come on)
I got three young shooters down to bust out the heat (Oh, what)
And oh, y'all ain't got nothin' on me (Hey)
Not one of y'all, y'all, gon' be messin' with me
I got two bad misses gon' be rubbin' my feet (Come one)
I got three young shooters down to bust out the heat
And oh, y'all ain't got nothin' on me

[Verse 4: YBN Cordae & Anderson .Paak]
Listen, I bought a Moncler coat for the times we were broke
I'ma wear it in the summer on LeBron James boat
Front row? Duh, bro, we don't sit on nosebleeds
Ain't your pockets obese? They won't fit in those seats
Ayy, we like a cold team, bro, Shaq and Kobe
Like back in '03, I was only like 6
I was like 16, but, I can give a sixteen
I can make a chick scream, that's a bit extreme
I got a thick bald chick, I call her Ms. Clean (Uh-huh)
My drip frosty like Halls and Listerine (Uh-huh)
We all all-stars, you hardly sixth string
Yeah, I had to ball hard to harvest these dreams
Swear to God, me too, no Harvey Weinstein
The coupe was lime green, my wrist was blinding
Prolly in New York, Ferraris and blue cheese
Bro, does that even mean? Just let the hook sing (Come on)

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak & YBN Cordae, Both]
One of y'all, y'all, gon' be messin' with me (Oh, what the-, wha-uh, come on)
I got two bad broads gon' be rubbin' my feet (Oh, what the-,  uh, come on)
I got three young shooters down to bust out the heat
And oh, y'all ain't got nothin' on me (Hey)
Not one of y'all, y'all, gon' be messin' with me (Come on)
I got two bad misses gon' be rubbin' my feet (Come on)
I got three young shooters down to bust out the heat
And oh, y'all ain't got nothin' on me

[Outro: Anderson .Paak & YBN Cordae]
YBN Cordae!

How Bout Now by Drake

[Intro]
That's the shit I'm talking 'bout though, like you changed up, you don't even fuckin' link nobody no more, you just dash me away like a cyattie. Yo, you cheesed me dog

[Verse 1]
Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss you
Shit'll come back around and get you
Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls' numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the bar exam
I drove in the snow for you? Yeah
You probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then
But how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)
And you stuck right now (Stuck right now)
Oh, you thought you had it all figured out back then
But how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)
And you stuck right now, yeah (Stuck right now)
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl
How 'bout now? Yeah
Girl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now, girl?
What about now, girl, how 'bout now?

[Interlude]
My heart belongs to you...

[Verse 2]
Yeah, always been daddy's little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas
He ain't even say thank you
I had no money left from actin', I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like "who's this?" I be like "me, girl"
You be like "oh, word, true shit?"
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
Them car rides made me feel like I was losin' it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that
Or I was average like that
Started drinkin' way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year
Guess I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year
Places that I should've been

[Chorus]
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then
But how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)
And you stuck right now (Stuck right now)
Oh, you thought you had it all figured out back then
Girl, how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)
And you stuck right now, yeah (Stuck right now)
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl
How 'bout now? Yeah
Girl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now, girl?
What about now, girl, how 'bout now?

[Outro]
My heart belongs to you
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do

The Motion by Drake

[Intro: Drake & Sampha]
It's not me and you, it's not me it's you
You're reckless and you know it, they don't love you like I do
Say you're moving on, well, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

[Verse 1: Drake]
I don't have a fuck to give, I've been moving state to state
In my leather and my Timbs like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chub, that's my nigga from the way
On the Eastside of the city, that's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling 'cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it I could never do no wrong
When they need a favor from you, man, they don't leave you alone
But I guess that's just the motion, yeah

[Chorus 1: Drake, Drake & Sampha, Sampha]
Then that phone doesn't ring
When they got everything, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, looking back on it, at least my pride is intact
'Cause we said "no strings attached" and I still got tied up in that
Everything that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her and she know it
The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help, but I guess that's just the motion, yeah

[Chorus 2: Drake, Drake & Sampha]
She'll probably come around
Soon as I settle down, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

[Outro: Drake, Sampha]
Nothing less and nothing more
I hear your heart hit the floor
I guess that's just the motion
Talking to you is not enough, no
I guess that s just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Yeah

Trust Issues by Drake

[Intro]
Uh
Aw yeah, aw yeah
Call up on drank and let's
Let's call up and, uh

[Interlude]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
I don't really give a fuck and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older, somebody should've told you
I'm on one (Ayy), fuck it, I'm on one (Yeah)
I said I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one, a strong one
Two white cups and I got that drink
It could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one
Aw yeah, aw yeah
You know what I'm
Oh yes, oh yeah
Oh yes, oh yeah
Uh, oh yes, oh yeah
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
You know what I'm sipping, I'll teach you how to mix it
But you're the only one 'cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping
So you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches
They might, they might catch me slipping and put in something different
So you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping
So you're the only one

[Chorus]
Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, woah, woah, woah

[Interlude]
Yeah, aw yeah, aw yeah
Let's call up on drank and let's all get wasted
On drank and let's all get faded, yeah, uh

[Verse 2]
Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the motherfuckin' North Side
Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sitting courtside
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You acting like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me, how the fuck we 'posed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?
I could tell, I could tell, I could tell
Certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess that they don't really make 'em like me no more, uh
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
'Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in and tell 'em all
Leave them cell phones on the table where we see them
I'm all day with it, man, AM to the PM
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him, oh

[Bridge]
That's that shit that drives me crazy
And it's all that I've been getting lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women want to fuck like they're me and I'm them
Looking for some things and I think that I can find 'em in you, in you

[Chorus]
Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, woah, woah, woah

[Outro]
Yeah, aw yeah, aw yeah
Let's call up on drank and let's all get wasted
On drank and let's all get faded, yeah
Aw yeah, aw yeah
Call up on drank and let's
Let's call up on, uh

[Verse 1: Drake]
I got car money, fresh start money
I want Saudi money, I want art money
I want women to cry and pour out they heart for me
And tell me how much they hate it when they apart from me
Yeah, and lately I do bitches the meanest
Tell 'em I love 'em and don't ever mean it
We go on dates, I send the Maybach out in neighborhoods
They never seen it
That shit is dangerous, but it's so convenient, I ain't lying
Yeah, and comfortable I sit
That manual Ferrari Italia's some fly shit
It's sitting at the house like I bought it in '96
'Cause honestly I'm too fucking busy to drive stick, I swear
Too fucking busy, too busy fuckin'
This nigga girl, but to me she wasn't
Been hot before they open doors for me, pre-heated oven
I'm in this ho
But I ain't finished though, it's been a minute though
My newest girl from back home got issues with parents
And some charges, how the fuck can I get her to Paris?
Luckily, I'm the greatest my country's ever seen
So chances are I get the border to issue me clearance
Dreams money can buy
Everybody yelled "Surprise!", I wasn't surprised
That's only 'cause I been waiting on it, nigga
So fuck whoever hating on a nigga
Of course...

[Chorus]
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Food from India, she in Charlotte Olympias
We talked music for hours, she never mentioned ya
Can't tell you how much I love when niggas think they got it
And I love the fact that line made 'em think about it
YMCMB
These niggas make it so hard to be friendly
When I know part of it's envy
Tryna fill the shoes, nigga, so far, these are empty
I take 'em off in the house because the throw carpets are Fendi
Ooh! I never seen the car you claim to drive
Or, shit, I seen it; you just ain't inside
And I feel like lately, it went from top five to remaining five
My favorite rappers either lost it or they ain't alive
And they tryna bring us down, me, Weezy, and Stunna
We stayed up, Christmas lights in the middle of summer
And if the girl standing next to me got a fat ass
Then I'll probably give her my number
Yeah, I throw my dollars up high
And they land on the stage you dance on
We got company coming over
Would it kill you to put some pants on?
Dreams money can buy
They told me it's like a high, and it wasn't a lie, yeah
Just have some good pussy waiting on a nigga
And fuck whoever hating on a nigga
Aw, yeah

[Chorus: Jai Paul]
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)

[Outro: Jai Paul]
Don't
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me
Don't

No Way! by Bazzi

[Chorus]
When I hop up in the Wraith
It's a high speed chase
Push the pedal to the floor
I won't quit, no way
You can't stall us
No matter what they say
I won't quit, no way
Fuckin' no way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
I'm the same old kid with the high school dreams
Got my eye on the prize, get it by any means
Just go, push the pedal to the floor
Game up in my hands, and bitch, I'll never let it go
Die for this shit, I would
No matter what they say, always knew that I could
There are things that I won't let them take from me
There are dreams that I won't let them take from me
Oh, yeah

[Bridge]
All my life I knew I could
Fantasized 'bout living good
Fuck the tens, I want the hunnids, yeah
Blue bands, just keep 'em comin', yeah
Tell the family we finally safe, but

[Chorus]
When I hop up in the Wraith
It's a high speed chase (It's a high speed chase)
Push the pedal to the floor (Floor)

Gold Roses (feat. Drake) by Rick Ross

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah
I'm home now, it's over now, so...
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
She got a thing for Chanel vintage that dropped before she could speak English
Do you love me or love seekin' attention, I mean which one is it?
You keep callin' me ya twin, but twins ain't this different
Mentally I'm already on next year, that's some 20/20 clear vision
You sayin' let you finish, I ain't tryna hear it
I'm all for spiritual liftin', but I don't fly Spirit
I'm all for findin' happiness, but down to die serious
All smiles, Kevin Durant trials
Had to blow it on the court, I must have blew a milli'
I'm walkin' on all charges, that's my new Achilles
I know they love to rock a check, but who gon' do it really? Really?
My depositions never surface
Tanenbaum know the logo on the jersey, it's gettin' purchased
Ten years in and y'all yet to hear my most impressive verses
Paid the cost to be the boss wasn't even my most expensive purchase
Trust when I say I'm never on the shit they assumin' I'm on
Tales about me are like
Sashimi from Saito, you know that man two Michelin Star
Postcard from Grace Bay, sendin' my distant regards
Vision wasn't mine, told my niggas the vision was ours
Still a part of shorty even if we've been livin' apart
Roxx'll do you filthy for me soon as I give him the nod
Meanin' he'll blast for me like puttin' the 6 with the God
Hop on a float to show the city the one they appointed
The one that's rebuildin' schools and feedin' the homeless
Hang with my niggas, but sometimes I be tryna avoid it
'Cause they'll get to poppin' out of place like they double jointed
Goals was the top of the pyramid in this shitty world
"I gotta get the most of everything" is the axis on which it sit and twirls
Point blank period, like a City Girl and then I bring it back to 50 world

[Chorus: Drake & Rick Ross]
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, it's too late
This different right here, yo

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I was nominated, never won a Grammy
But I understand, they'll never understand me
Lot of lives lost, but I never panicked
Lot of lines crossed, I never did a Xanny
A hundred room mansion but I felt abandoned
Love makin' love, but where will love land me?
Jealous, so their bitches be actin' like they sleepin' on us
But they speakin' on us, jewelers quote us even numbers
Still blowin' smoke as angels float above us
Love givin' back, but will they ever love us?
Chanel in the mail, FedEx from Pharrell
And what I got for sale just sit on the scale
Triple beam dream, a buck on the shades
I really seen things give mothers the shakes
I really bought cars for women on face
I know it seem odd, but money amazin'
College loans really did fuck up her credit
Discover cards, look back, I know she regret it
But we keep pushin', keep our foot on the pedal
In the mirror she a blessin', rebukin' the devil
Livin' on the edge, she keepin' me level
Money come and go, I'ma keep you forever
Money come and go, I'ma keep you forever (Forever)
Slip-on glass slippers and tickle with feathers
Everywhere we go, we create a dilemma
Coming to America, really the set
I'll let your soul glow, I'm keepin' you wet
All my cold Decembers, I know she remembers
Forgiveness for a sinner, but is it that simple?
Holdin' on your hands, your body's a temple
Fly you out to Cannes, ménages with bitches
Lobsters and the prawns, thought you was Spanish
Bottles for the Don, our parties the biggest (Biggest, biggest)
(Maybach Music)

[Chorus: Drake]
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, too late (Ayy)

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Had a dream she was singin' to me like Gladys Knight
True love in the projects is called paradise
All your niggas left, you wasn't actin' right
But honesty itself a small sacrifice
My money bag heavy, got me packin' light
You movin' funny, can you fill my appetite?
Niggas' conversations, a lot of it false
He own condos right over Carnegie Hall
Speak about your cars, but all of 'em parked
Your niggas' money light, come out of the dark
You really are my type, that's not a facade
One of the reasons why I write, we got a synopsis
I'm always at the top of barbershop gossip
After further thought, better not knock 'em
Allocate some dollars to go out shoppin'
Bitch, we on the real, it's time to stop talkin' (Stop talkin', stop talkin')

[Chorus: Drake]
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, too late (Ayy)

Lover by Taylor Swift

[Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

What's the Move (feat. Lil Uzi Vert) by Young Thug

[Intro: Young Thug]
(BL$$D)
I just let lil' mama suck me up, girl
Is you tryna cry in a Rolls Royce or the bus, girl?
I jumped off the porch and went straight up, girl (Straight up, girl)
You can leave your town and head to another world

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
What the move?
I'm tired of eyein' you
I'm tired of spyin' on you
'Til the pain last too
I made it rain on you
When it was hard to maintain too
I was playin' games with you
Like you could never play games too, woah (Yeah)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
You just gotta tell me what you want (Tell me what you want)
Louis Vuitton, diamonds, keep calm (Okay)
All you do is point at what you want (Point it out)
Crystal cut pointers in the charm, c'mon (Oh yeah)
Thirty-five dollars for a duff' (For a duff')
Nigga tryna buy the cash cost (Woo)
Percy Miller, brazy with the woes
Thirty-five dollars for a duff' (For a duff')
You make it twerk for me
You get a purse from me
Eighty thousand dollars for her Birkin
You get a verse for free
I make her worship me
Copy it in bursts for me
Turn to a P-I-M-P, I make her work for me
You don't want the bag, oh no, no, no
I make her drop it and pop it and work it on my nose
I make her shut up then suck it, she fuckin' at my shows, mmh
I make her shut up, she fuckin', she suckin' at my shows, ayy

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Drip, drip, no shoestring my sneaker, won't trip
My jeans is so tight they don't fit
Still walk around with a stick on my hip
VVS diamonds right behind my lip
Don't walk with less than fifty on my wrist
Diamonds so cold on my neck, it got me sick
Raf Simons, mix it up with the Rick
Flexin' on these haters who sent me 'my bad'
Made it from the soil, made it from the Rex
Richer than your first, richer than your last
LUV, know I got swag
Pop a rubber band, pop another Xan'
I groove around, party pack my hand
I'm seeing double lookin' through my lens
Tell me what you want, I just want your friend

[Chorus: Young Thug]
You just gotta tell me what you want (Tell me what you want)

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Diamonds, they drip down my wrist
Let's get it, fuck all the skits, woo
Left wrist sittin' on a brick (Left wrist)
Bitch have it locked like a pick (Sheesh)
Fittz Park, came for the shit
Grab a AK for the wrist
Gorilla, rockin' Bape on a bitch
Potential court case on a bitch (Bitch)
We livin' state to state on a bitch (We livin' state to state, yeah)
We never ever play with the bitch (We never ever play, no)
Do everything the same on a bitch (Never tell the difference)
We known to pick the brains of a bitch (Big bag)
I throw the big B's on a bitch
I got a few C's on a bitch (Got slatt)
I'm in another league on a bitch
My diamond 'bout to ski on a bitch (Woo)

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
What's the move?
I'm tired of eyein' you (Oh, yeah)
I was tired of spyin' on you
'Til the pain last too (Yeah)

Soon You ll Get Better (feat. Dixie Chicks) by Taylor Swift

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you
Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you...

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Dixie Chicks]
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isn't real
I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky
I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try
And I say to you...

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Dixie Chicks]
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Dixie Chicks]
And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to?
What am I supposed to do
If there's no you?

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
This won't go back to normal, if it ever was
It's been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because
'Cause I have to

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Dixie Chicks]
Ooh-ah
You'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

Daylight by Taylor Swift

[Verse 1]
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight

[Verse 2]
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

[Bridge]
And I can still see it all (In my mind)
All of you, all of me (Intertwined)
I once believed love would be (Black and white)
But it's golden (Golden)
And I can still see it all (In my head)
Back and forth from New York (Sneaking in your bed)
I once believed love would be (Burning red)
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, daylight

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
And I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)
(And I can still see it all)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(And I can still see it all, back and forth from New York)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(I once believed love would be burning red)

[Outro]
Like daylight
It's golden like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go

[Spoken Outro]
I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of
Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
I, I just think that
You are what you love

It s Nice To Have A Friend by Taylor Swift

[Intro]
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse 1]
School bell rings, walk me home
Sidewalk chalk covered in snow
Lost my gloves, you give me one
"Wanna hang out?" Yeah, sounds like fun
Video games, you pass me a note
Sleeping in tents

[Chorus]
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
Light pink sky, up on the roof
Sun sinks down, no curfew
20 questions, we tell the truth
You've been stressed out lately, yeah, me too
Something gave you the nerve
To touch my hand

[Chorus]
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)

[Instrumental bridge]

[Verse 3]
Church bells ring, carry me home
Rice on the ground looks like snow
Call my bluff, call you "Babe"
Have my back, yeah, every day
Feels like home, stay in bed
The whole weekend

[Chorus]
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
(Ooh)

NO HALO by BROCKHAMPTON

[Intro: Kevin Abstract]
I don't know where I'm goin'
If  I gotta take the high road, I'm rollin'

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
I  ain't tryna get like all up in your head again, Montana, 'Lanta
Maybe I should just go mosey my ass over to your house
Bewildered by the sight of you up on the couch, so cozy
Lowly  lit lights, rosy cheeks, oh, you so cozy with somebody else
Get  nervous, my stomach churnin', burnin'
I'm beat, ready to knock some teeth out of his ass
Late  night corner, we pass
Lick that Swisher, get red
Used to skip rocks 'round that bend
We don't go there no more
We  don't see sun no more
Baby wanna raid the whole apartment like the FBI
Takin' everything, from pots and pans to fans to Goldeneye
Everything 'cept the dog
Everything in the drawers
Used to be so perfect, but it's never gettin' solved

[Chorus: Deb Never, Merlyn Wood, & Deb Never & Matt Champion]
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Do I matter? I'm ecstatic, I'm depressed
More like God's special mess, never had no halo
Trippy, I can barely hike it out of bed
Time bomb under it, persuading you to hop in
Mmm, options, runnin' out of options
Mmm, options, used to have options
Mmm, options, runnin' out of options
Mmm, options, used to have options

[Pre-Chorus: Deb Never & Kevin Abstract]
I don't know where I'm goin'
If I gotta take the high road, I'm rollin'
I don't know where I'm goin'
If I gotta take the high road, I'm rollin'

[Chorus: Deb Never, Merlyn Wood, & Deb Never & Matt Champion]
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Used to fight all my night terrors, now I smoke through the dreams
Depression put me into places where I'm stuck in the seams
They sealed my mouth and said the only way to breathe is to scream
Pop the stitches from society and fall to my knees
The machines weavin' our fate are gettin' harder to please
But I believe to an extreme
(That we all can find a way)
To anybody listenin' that's in between
(That we all can find a way)

[Verse 4: Joba]
Went to church for the hell of it, stumbled in drunk as shit
Been goin' through it again
Been talkin' to myself, wonderin' who I am
Been thinkin' I am better than Him
In times like these, I just need to believe it's all part of a plan
Lost a part of me, but I am still here

[Bridge: bearface]
Wash it out of all of me to feel the fire (Maybe I'll be gone for a minute)
But you know, you know that's a lie (No one help me when my eyes go)
Wash it out of all of me to feel the fire (Maybe I'll be gone for a minute)
But you know, you know that's a lie (No one help me when my eyes go)

[Chorus: Deb Never, Merlyn Wood, & Deb Never & Matt Champion]
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help me when my
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help me when my

Fuck it I love you by Lana Del Rey

[Verse 1]
I like to see everything in neon
Drink  lime green, stay up 'til dawn
Maybe  the way that I'm living is killing me
I like to light up the stage with a song
Do shit to keep me turned on
But  one day I woke up like
"Maybe  I'll do it differently"

[Pre-Chorus]
So I moved to California, but it's just a state of mind
It  turns out everywhere you go, you take yourself, that's not a lie
Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
It's killing me slowly

[Chorus]
Dream a little dream of me
Make  me into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do

[Verse 2]
I used to shoot up my veins in neon
And shit's even brighter; you're gone
So many things I would say to you
I want you

[Pre-Chorus]
You moved to California, but it's just a state of mind
And you know everyone adores you
You can't feel it and you're tired
Baby, wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
But it's killing me slowly

[Chorus]
Dream a little dream of me
Turn this into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do

[Bridge]
It turns out California's more than just a state of mind
I met you on the boulevard, wind through my hair, you blew my mind
And if I wasn't so fucked up, I think I'd fuck you all the time
(I really do)
It's killing me slowly

[Chorus]
Fuck it, I love you (I moved to California, but it's just a state of mind)
Fuck it, I love you (It turns out everywhere you go, you take yourself, that's not a lie)
Fuck it, I love you (Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine)
I really do (It's killing me slowly)

[Outro]
(Fuck it, I love you)
California dreamin', got my money on my mind
(Fuck it, I love you)
Chances in my veins, running out of time
(Fuck it, I love you)
California dreamin', got my money on my mind
(I really do)
Chances in my veins, running out of time
(Fuck it, I love you)
California dreamin', got my money on my mind
(Fuck it, I love you)
Chances in my veins, running out of time
(Fuck it, I love you)
California dreamin', got my money on my mind
(I really do)
Chances in my veins, running out of time

SUGAR by BROCKHAMPTON

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
I move mountains on my own, don't need nobody help
Changed your mind when I changed my life, better start believin' in myself
And we all out lookin' for, lookin' for God so we never see it in ourself
Shit, divine intervention move in stealth
It's hard to tell what the prayer compelled
You can find me dancin' in between the raindrops
Tryna find a way to make the pain stop
Overtime, on the graveyard
Got a nigga feeling brainwashed
My instability's trademark
Copy-written in all my decisions
This is not supposed to be a way of livin'
Turned my temple down into a prison, shit

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Yeah, back on Vincent with the braces on
Used to slide out the back without the neighbors knowin'
Pose for the picture with the pearly whites
Dead lens zoomin' in, catchin' all my strikes
Used to trade Jordan for some molly
And she gave me all I need for the night, forties suffice
Morally alright, but I need some advice
And I know that I'm actin' foolish
Chris would pick me up around noon-ish
Half a blunt, yeah, we coolin'
Twist it up, puttin' on OutKast
Hunnid, Texas heat, and yeah, we cruisin'

[Pre-Chorus: bearface]
But when I love you right, I love you right
All by yourself
But I'll make it bright, baby, I want you to know
I'ma be there for you, I'ma make you see that
I want you, I want you

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Back and forth
I'll take that if that's all you askin' for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport, pa-passport
Back and forth
I'll take that if that's all you askin' for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport, pa-passport
Back and forth
I'll take that if that's all you askin' for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport, pa-passport

Do you love me, love me? Oh
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?

Circles by Post Malone

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh,  oh, oh
Oh,  oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
I  couldn't be there even when I tried
You  don't believe it, we do this every time

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed  the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Verse 2]
Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Bridge]
Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me, what you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
It's only me, let it go

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Norman fucking Rockwell by Lana Del Rey

[Verse 1]
Goddamn, man-child
You fucked me so good that I almost said "I love you"
You're fun and you re wild
But you don't know the half of the shit that you put me through
Your poetry's bad and you blame the news
But I can t change that, and I can't change your mood, ah

[Chorus]
'Cause you're just a man
It's just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue, blue

[Verse 2]
Goddamn, man-child
You act like a kid even though you stand six foot two
Self-loathing poet, resident Laurel Canyon know-it-all
You talk to the walls when the party gets bored of you
But I don't get bored, I just see it through
Why wait for the best when I could have you? You?

[Chorus]
'Cause you re just a man
It s just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue
You make me blue

[Outro]
Blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue

Fuck it I love you by Lana Del Rey

[Verse 1]
I like to see everything in neon
Drink  lime green, stay up 'til dawn
Maybe  the way that I'm living is killing me
I like to light up the stage with a song
Do shit to keep me turned on
But  one day I woke up like
"Maybe  I'll do it differently"

[Pre-Chorus]
So I moved to California, but it's just a state of mind
It  turns out everywhere you go, you take yourself, that's not a lie
Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
It's killing me slowly

[Chorus]
Dream a little dream of me
Make  me into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do

[Verse 2]
I used to shoot up my veins in neon
And shit's even brighter; you're gone
So many things I would say to you

Cinnamon Girl by Lana Del Rey

[Verse 1]
Cinnamon in my teeth
From your kiss, you're touching me
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work
You try to push me out, but I just find my way back in
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me out, I win

[Chorus]
There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, help me
Be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, help me
Be the first who ever did

[Verse 2]
Kerosene in my hands
You make me mad, on fire again
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work

[Chorus]
There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, help me
Be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, help me
Be the first who ever did

[Chorus]
There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did

Mariners Apartment Complex by Lana Del Rey

[Verse 1]
You took my sadness out of context
At the Mariners Apartment Complex
I ain't no candle in the wind
I'm the board, the lightning, the thunder
Kind of girl who's gonna make you wonder
Who you are and who you've been

[Pre-Chorus]
And who I've been is with you on these beaches
Your Venice bitch, your die-hard, your weakness
Maybe I could save you from your sins
So kiss the sky and whisper to Jesus
My, my, my, you found this, you need this
Take a deep breath, baby, let me in

[Chorus]
You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man

[Verse 2]
They mistook my kindness for weakness
I fucked up, I know that, but Jesus
Can't a girl just do the best she can?
Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Think about it, the darkness, the deepness
All the things that make me who I am

[Pre-Chorus]
And who I am is a big-time believer
That people can change, but you don't have to leave her
When everyone's talking, you can make a stand
'Cause even in the dark, I feel your resistance
You can see my heart burning in the distance
Baby, baby, baby, I'm your man (Yeah)

[Chorus]
You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man

[Outro]
Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Take in the sweetness
You want this, you need this
Are you ready for it?
Are you ready for it?
Are you ready for it?

The greatest by Lana Del Rey

[Verse 1]
I miss Long Beach and I miss you, babe
I miss dancing with you the most of all
I miss the bar where the Beach Boys would go
Dennis' last stop before Kokomo

[Pre-Chorus]
Those nights were on fire
We couldn't get higher
We didn't know that we had it all
But nobody warns you before the fall

[Chorus]
And I'm wasted
Don't leave, I just need a wake-up call
I'm facing the greatest
The greatest loss of them all
The culture is lit and I had a ball
I guess I'm signing off after all

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I miss New York and I miss the music
Me and my friends, we miss rock 'n' roll
I want shit to feel just like it used to
When, baby, I was doing nothin' the most of all

[Pre-Chorus]
The culture is lit, and if this is it, I had a ball
I guess that I'm burned out after all

[Chorus]
I'm wasted
Don't leave, I just need a wake-up call
I'm facing the greatest
The greatest loss of them all
The culture is lit and I had a ball
I guess that I'm burned out after all

[Outro]
If this is it, I'm signing off
Miss doing nothin' the most of all
Hawaii just missed that fireball
L.A. is in flames, it's getting hot
Kanye West is blond and gone
"Life on Mars" ain't just a song
I hope the live stream's almost on

California by Lana Del Rey

[Intro]
(One, two, three, four)

[Verse 1]
You don't ever have to be stronger than you really are
When you're lying in my arms, baby
You don't ever have to go faster than your fastest pace
Or faster than my fastest cars

[Pre-Chorus]
I shouldn't have done it, but I read it in your letter
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
I wanted to reach out, but I never said a thing
I shouldn't have done it, but I read it in your letter
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
I wanted to call you, but I didn't say a thing
(Two, three, four)

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flip side
If you come back to California, you should just hit me up
We'll do whatever you want, travel wherever how far
We'll hit up all the old places
We'll have a party, we'll dance 'til dawn
I'll pick up all of your Vogues and all of your Rolling Stones
Your favorite liquor off the top shelf
I'll throw a party all night long

[Verse 2]
You don't ever have to be stronger than you really are
When you're lying in my arms, and, honey
You don't ever have to act cooler than you think you should
You're brighter than the brightest stars

[Pre-Chorus]
You're scared to win, scared to lose
I've heard the war was over if you really choose
The one in and around you
You hate the heat, you got the blues
Changing like the weather, oh, that's so like you
The Santa Ana moves you
(Two, three, four)

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flip side
If you come back to California, you should just hit me up
We'll do whatever you want, travel wherever how far
We'll hit up all the old places
We'll have a party, we'll dance 'til dawn
I'll pick up all of your Vogues and all of your Rolling Stones
Your favorite liquor off the top shelf
I'll throw a party all night long

[Outro]
Oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flip side
If you come back to California, you should just hit me up

Circles by Post Malone

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh,  oh, oh
Oh,  oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
I  couldn't be there even when I tried
You  don't believe it, we do this every time

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed  the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Verse 2]
Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Bridge]
Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me, what you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
It's only me, let it go

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Hollywood's Bleeding by Post Malone

[Intro]
Hollywood's bleeding, vampires feedin'
Darkness turns to dust
Everyone's gone, but no one's leavin'
Nobody left but us
Tryna chase a feelin', but we'll never feel it
Ridin' on the last train home
Dyin' in our sleep, we're livin' out a dream
We only make it out alone

[Chorus]
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
Was scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're running out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding, but we call it home

[Verse]
Outside, the winter sky turnin' grey
City up in smoke, it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse and tell herself that she okay
It seem like dying young is an honor
But who'd be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out, and all they eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth
This is more than I can handle
Blood in my Lambo'
Wish I could go, oh, I'm losin' ho-ope
I light a candle, some Palo Santo
For all these demons, wish I could just go on

[Chorus]
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
Was scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're running out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding, but we call it home

[Intro: Post Malone]
Oh

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
I never needed anything from you
And all I ever asked was for the truth (All I ever asked was for)
You showed your tongue and it was forked in two
Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you (Almost believed you)
Yeah, you preyed on my every mistake
Waited on me to break, held me under hopin' I would drown
Like a plague, I was wasting away
Tryna find my way out, find my way out (Find my way out)

I start giving my heart away
For Heaven's sake, my bones will break
But you'll never own my soul, no

I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
I took them stones you threw, made chains for the crew (Ice)
I brought up 10 hoes, this coupe only made for two (Yessir)
They all ran through it, it ain't nothin' left to do
I need some more reasons to live out this evening (Straight up)
I've been sippin' forever and just taking whatever
Hoping, thinking whenever you'll be back around
Let's go our ways, whichever
You say how is however long
'Cause you know I'll never be alone (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Travis Scott]
Love (Love, yeah)
Shorty gon' back (Shorty gon, shorty gon' back)
Need it on sight (Need it on, need it on sight)
Crack it all back (Crack it all, crack it all back)
Give her that pipe (Give her that, give her that pipe)
All of my gang (All of my, all of my gang)
Shawty went bad (Shawty went, shawty went bad)

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne & Post Malone]
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

Take it all away
Why don't you (Take what you want, take what you need)
Take what you need from me, yeah
(Take what you want) Why don't you (Take what you need)
(What you need, yeah)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Used to have friends now I got enemies (Ooh)
Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me (Damn)
Used to have friends now I got enemies (Ooh)
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
They said I would never get this far, ah, ah

Laughin' to the bank like ha, ha, ha
Guess that I'm just talkin' too much blah, blah, blah (Shut the fuck up)
So, where did y'all go? (Ooh)
When I was shit broke couldn't even buy smokes
Now your mama needs tickets to my stadium show (Stadium show)
She love it when she hear me on the radio, oh
I know it's hard to swallow your pride
Sorry that you can't get over me (Over me)
Now you're out my life, I'm so relieved, I

Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
Close to my enemies (Let's go)
I need better energy (Huh?)
When I told you fuck you, you thought I was playin', huh?
(Yeah, yeah) But I meant the shit literally
She want to vibe but I told her fuck that (Nope)
She looking at me like she surprised
They're packin' the post and I'm home alone
When the box hit the door, they go for 35
I try to put on for my partners, they turn into enemies right before a nigga eye
You reach for a shake, I'ma hold out a fist
Giving a nigga a quarter pound without the fries
I just went double platinum with no features
Just to show a nigga, I don't really need him
Pass a man a plate and he can make it shake
It's guaranteed he'll fold and bite the hand that feed him
And I know you think that I ain't see it
And I know you bitch ain't got a car
Don't make me go and buy a bitch a lil' Prius
Fuck on the camera, we can call it even
Friends are like the autumn, every year they leavin'
And I'ma rake 'em in a pile, throw 'em in a bag
Tie them bitches up and leave 'em
'Cause most of these niggas are deceiving
And I (Ooh)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Used to have friends now I got enemies (Damn)
Used to keep 'em close now they dead to me (Ooh)
Money tend to show all they tendencies (Damn)
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Post-Chorus: Post Malone]
Sometimes, every time, they let me down (They let me down)
Sometimes, every time, they let me down (They let me down)
Used to have friends now I got enemies
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Bridge: Post Malone]
It's too late to turn this shit around (It's too late)
Only held me down when you wanted me to drown
It's too late to turn this shit around (It's too late)
So don't try and tell me that you're happy for me now

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Used to have friends now I got enemies
Used to keep 'em close now they dead to me (Dead to me)
Money tend to show all they tendencies (Tendencies)
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Post-Chorus: Post Malone]
Sometimes, every time, they let me down (They let me down)
Sometimes, every time, they let me down (They let me down)
Used to have friends now I got enemies
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Outro: Post Malone]
Ooh, it's too late
It's too late

Said you'd die, said you'd die
But you lied, you lied to me

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
It was love at first sight, felt like you were chosen (Oh)
But that blood in your veins, yeah, I know it's frozen (It's so cold)
Got no patience no more (No)
Been waitin' too long (Yeah)
You hid that shit away and I was the last one to know, bitch (Ayy)
I heard you comin' in, I was lyin' there awake
Didn't know that it was you, got the gun right out the safe (Damn)
Remember when you got my ass arrested (Wow)
At least when I was in jail, I got some rest in (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
Ooh, I surrender (Ayy), time to forget ya (Ayy)
I'm too tired to forgive ya (Ayy), it's too hard on my liver (Ayy)
And you know (Ayy) it s all (Ayy) over now
All your friends (Ayy), you know (Ayy) they sold you out

[Chorus: Post Malone & Future]

But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me, yeah (You lied, yeah)

[Verse 2: Future]
It was a VIP, happened to be one of my best nights
9 AM, I came from out the club, it was daylight (Daylight)
Got a bad girl, I was treating her too nice (I was treating her too nice)
Caught you being vulnerable, that ain't what I need (That ain't what I need)
You just sold your soul, girl, quit crying (Sold your soul)
Your passport, it looks like you lying (Know you cold)
You broken down by your past, don't deny it (You know I know)
Your ex called, you was vulnerable, you flying, nah (Flying)
Wasn't on the best of terms, girl, I was trying (I was trying on ya)
I did everything to reach out to you (I was reaching out)
Said you never had me caught up in no drama (No drama)
I done ran into my karma (I done ran)

Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me

[Verse 3: Halsey]
Settle down, I'll spell it out, it's simple enough
I came around, I figured out, should follow my gut
I don't play anymore, I went through your phone
And called the girls in your DMs and took all them home
And I know it's been a while since the last time you heard from me
Grew into a savage and that's why they gave this verse to me
Turns out it shows 'cause they turn out at shows
I sold 15 million copies of a break-up note
Brought some strangers in our beds
And now you lost your right to privacy
Spilling all our secrets
When you thought they'd probably die with me
Know you fucking love it on the low
And you don't have to say I'm crazy
'Cause I know nothing's changed though

[Chorus: Post Malone & Halsey, Halsey]
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)

Y'all just sit back, get your kick back

For nobody who's just fake in life, ayy, ayy
You ain t really who you say you are
So pick up the pace, there ain't no slowin' me up (Slowin' me up)
Get the fuck out my face, can you stop blowing me up?

Bought a new car 'fore you woke up for breakfast, yeah

You ain't my day one and I know you not my friend
So I can't judge you when you do some phony shit and just pretend
Like you really down with me, because bein' loyal starts within
I seen that money overpower that love and turn it thin
But it ain't stop me, I just kept goin' up, took it on the chin
I wish every time they said I would fold, I'd make an M
Fuck around and be as rich as Jeff Bezos, say it again
Never lose, I go overtime on 'em, stay in that gym
Let's get it

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain't ever seein' me fold under pressure

'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
I'm tired of bein' tired
This my last shot, you can't be mad, at least I tried
We supposed to be grown, but yet you still acting childish
I can get on the jet alone, I don't need no extra baggage
This year turned into a savage, I got baguettes in my necklace
Driving fast and I won't crash it and I'm supposed to be sober
But some kind of way, I just keep getting loaded
It's gonna take more than some pressure to fold me
Tried as hard as I can, but at this point it's outta my hands
I ain't runnin' out of these bands for nothin' or no one
She say I'm a dog, but it takes one to know one
Been goin' hard, been by myself, I don't need no love

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain't ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

[Outro: Post Malone]
Mm, oh, oh no
Mm, oh, oh no
On the road, oh

But why can't you believe them?
Too bad for you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, we fight and we fuck until we open the cuts
And now we're soberin' up but never sober enough
Allergic, allergic
Instead of holdin' me down you're only holding me up
It shouldn't be so hard, this is impossible love
Allergic, allergic

[Pre-Chorus]
I took your pills and your drugs just to feel something else
'Cause I can't feel you no more

[Chorus]
So sad, but true
You're friends with all my demons
The only one that sees them
Too bad for you
So sad, but true
Gave a hundred million reasons
But why can't you believe them?
Too bad for you

[Outro]
So sad, but true
Gave a hundred million reasons
But why can't you believe them?
Too bad for you

Feed  the flame 'cause we can't let go

Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Verse 2]
Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

[Chorus]

Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go

[Intro: Post Malone]
Oh

[Chorus: Ozzy Osbourne]
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

[Verse 1: Post Malone]

And all I ever asked was for the truth (All I ever asked was for)
You showed your tongue and it was forked in two
Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you (Almost believed you)

Waited on me to break, held me under hopin' I would drown
Like a plague, I was wasting away
Tryna find my way out, find my way out (Find my way out)

For Heaven's sake, my bones will break

You bled me dry just like the tears you never show

Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

They all ran through it, it ain't nothin' left to do
I need some more reasons to live out this evening (Straight up)

Hoping, thinking whenever you'll be back around
Let's go our ways, whichever
You say how is however long
'Cause you know I'll never be alone (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Travis Scott]
Love (Love, yeah)
Shorty gon' back (Shorty gon, shorty gon' back)
Need it on sight (Need it on, need it on sight)
Crack it all back (Crack it all, crack it all back)
Give her that pipe (Give her that, give her that pipe)
All of my gang (All of my, all of my gang)
Shawty went bad (Shawty went, shawty went bad)

Hollywood's Bleeding by Post Malone

[Intro]
Hollywood's bleeding, vampires feedin'
Darkness turns to dust
Everyone's gone, but no one's leavin'
Nobody left but us
Tryna chase a feelin', but we'll never feel it
Ridin' on the last train home
Dyin' in our sleep, we're livin' out a dream
We only make it out alone

[Chorus]
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
Was scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're running out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding, but we call it home

[Verse]
Outside, the winter sky turnin' grey
City up in smoke, it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse and tell herself that she okay
It seem like dying young is an honor
But who'd be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out, and all they eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth
This is more than I can handle
Blood in my Lambo'
Wish I could go, oh, I'm losin' ho-ope
I light a candle, some Palo Santo
For all these demons, wish I could just go on

[Chorus]
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
Was scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're running out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding, but we call it home

Enemies (feat. DaBaby) by Post Malone

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Used to have friends now I got enemies (Ooh)
Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me (Damn)
Used to have friends now I got enemies (Ooh)
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
They said I would never get this far, ah, ah
Think that we don't see who you are, are, are?
Laughin' to the bank like ha, ha, ha
Guess that I'm just talkin' too much blah, blah, blah (Shut the fuck up)
So, where did y'all go? (Ooh)
When I was shit broke couldn't even buy smokes
Now your mama needs tickets to my stadium show (Stadium show)
She love it when she hear me on the radio, oh
I know it's hard to swallow your pride
Sorry that you can't get over me (Over me)
Now you're out my life, I'm so relieved, I

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Used to have friends now I got enemies (Damn)
Used to keep 'em close now they dead to me (Ooh)
Money tend to show all they tendencies (Damn)
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Post-Chorus: Post Malone]
Sometimes, every time, they let me down (They let me down)
Sometimes, every time, they let me down (They let me down)
Used to have friends now I got enemies
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
Close to my enemies (Let's go)
I need better energy (Huh?)
When I told you fuck you, you thought I was playin', huh?
(Yeah, yeah) But I meant the shit literally
She want to vibe but I told her fuck that (Nope)
She looking at me like she surprised
They're packin' the post and I'm home alone
When the box hit the door, they go for 35
I try to put on for my partners, they turn into enemies right before a nigga eye
You reach for a shake, I'ma hold out a fist
Giving a nigga a quarter pound without the fries
I just went double platinum with no features
Just to show a nigga, I don't really need him
Pass a man a plate and he can make it shake
It's guaranteed he'll fold and bite the hand that feed him
And I know you think that I ain't see it
And I know you bitch ain't got a car
Don't make me go and buy a bitch a lil' Prius
Fuck on the camera, we can call it even
Friends are like the autumn, every year they leavin'
And I'ma rake 'em in a pile, throw 'em in a bag
Tie them bitches up and leave 'em
'Cause most of these niggas are deceiving
And I (Ooh)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Used to have friends now I got enemies (Damn)
Used to keep 'em close now they dead to me (Ooh)
Money tend to show all they tendencies (Damn)
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Post-Chorus: Post Malone]
Sometimes, every time, they let me down (They let me down)
Sometimes, every time, they let me down (They let me down)
Used to have friends now I got enemies
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Bridge: Post Malone]
It's too late to turn this shit around (It's too late)
Only held me down when you wanted me to drown
It's too late to turn this shit around (It's too late)
So don't try and tell me that you're happy for me now

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Used to have friends now I got enemies
Used to keep 'em close now they dead to me (Dead to me)
Money tend to show all they tendencies (Tendencies)
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Post-Chorus: Post Malone]
Sometimes, every time, they let me down (They let me down)
Sometimes, every time, they let me down (They let me down)
Used to have friends now I got enemies
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

Said you'd die, said you'd die
But you lied, you lied to me

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
It was love at first sight, felt like you were chosen (Oh)
But that blood in your veins, yeah, I know it's frozen (It's so cold)
Got no patience no more (No)
Been waitin' too long (Yeah)
You hid that shit away and I was the last one to know, bitch (Ayy)
I heard you comin' in, I was lyin' there awake
Didn't know that it was you, got the gun right out the safe (Damn)
Remember when you got my ass arrested (Wow)
At least when I was in jail, I got some rest in (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
Ooh, I surrender (Ayy), time to forget ya (Ayy)
I'm too tired to forgive ya (Ayy), it's too hard on my liver (Ayy)
And you know (Ayy) it s all (Ayy) over now
All your friends (Ayy), you know (Ayy) they sold you out

[Chorus: Post Malone & Future]

[Verse 2: Future]
It was a VIP, happened to be one of my best nights
9 AM, I came from out the club, it was daylight (Daylight)
Got a bad girl, I was treating her too nice (I was treating her too nice)
Caught you being vulnerable, that ain't what I need (That ain't what I need)
You just sold your soul, girl, quit crying (Sold your soul)
Your passport, it looks like you lying (Know you cold)
You broken down by your past, don't deny it (You know I know)
Your ex called, you was vulnerable, you flying, nah (Flying)
Wasn't on the best of terms, girl, I was trying (I was trying on ya)
I did everything to reach out to you (I was reaching out)
Said you never had me caught up in no drama (No drama)
I done ran into my karma (I done ran)

Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me

[Verse 3: Halsey]
Settle down, I'll spell it out, it's simple enough
I came around, I figured out, should follow my gut
I don't play anymore, I went through your phone
And called the girls in your DMs and took all them home
And I know it's been a while since the last time you heard from me
Grew into a savage and that's why they gave this verse to me
Turns out it shows 'cause they turn out at shows
I sold 15 million copies of a break-up note
Brought some strangers in our beds
And now you lost your right to privacy
Spilling all our secrets
When you thought they'd probably die with me
Know you fucking love it on the low
And you don't have to say I'm crazy
'Cause I know nothing's changed though

[Chorus: Post Malone & Halsey, Halsey]
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)

Graveyard by Halsey

[Verse 1]
It's crazy when
The thing you love the most is the detriment
Let that sink in
You can think again
When the hand you wanna hold is a weapon and
You're nothin' but skin

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running, I keep running, I keep running

[Chorus]
They say I may be making a mistake
I woulda followed all the way, no matter how far
I know when you go down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard
Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running when both my feet hurt
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
Oh, when you go down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard (No, oh)

[Verse 2]
You look at me (Look at me)
With eyes so dark, don't know how you even see
You push right through me (Push right through me)
It's gettin' real
You lock the door, you're drunk at the steering wheel
And I can't conceal

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, 'cause I've been diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running, I keep running, I keep running

[Chorus]
They say I may be making a mistake
I woulda followed all the way, no matter how far
I know when you go down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard
Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running when both my feet hurt
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
Oh, when you go down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard

[Bridge]
Oh, it's funny how
The warning signs can feel like they're butterflies

[Chorus]
Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running when both my feet hurt
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
Oh, when you go down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain t ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on  em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never

And I m only 24, but, bitch, I been through it all
I got so many hits, can t remember them all (Ooh)
While I'm takin  a shit, look at the plaques on the wall
Y'all just sit back, get your kick back
Keep on actin' like you did that, got no respect
For nobody who's just fake in life, ayy, ayy
You ain t really who you say you are
So pick up the pace, there ain't no slowin' me up (Slowin' me up)
Get the fuck out my face, can you stop blowing me up?
'Cause my time is expensive, one mill a setlist
Bought a new car 'fore you woke up for breakfast, yeah

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain't ever seen me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever (Too clever)
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never

Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Yeah, where you been? (Where you been?)
When it was time to do some work and put it in (Put it in)
I just be laughin' when I see 'em, look at them (Ha)
Leave when I lose and pop back up as soon as I win (Uh)
You ain't my day one and I know you not my friend
So I can't judge you when you do some phony shit and just pretend
Like you really down with me, because bein' loyal starts within
I seen that money overpower that love and turn it thin
But it ain't stop me, I just kept goin' up, took it on the chin
I wish every time they said I would fold, I'd make an M
Fuck around and be as rich as Jeff Bezos, say it again
Never lose, I go overtime on 'em, stay in that gym
Let's get it

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain't ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
I'm tired of bein' tired
This my last shot, you can't be mad, at least I tried
We supposed to be grown, but yet you still acting childish
I can get on the jet alone, I don't need no extra baggage
This year turned into a savage, I got baguettes in my necklace
Driving fast and I won't crash it and I'm supposed to be sober
But some kind of way, I just keep getting loaded
It's gonna take more than some pressure to fold me
Tried as hard as I can, but at this point it's outta my hands
I ain't runnin' out of these bands for nothin' or no one
She say I'm a dog, but it takes one to know one
Been goin' hard, been by myself, I don't need no love

[Chorus: Post Malone]
'Cause they ain't ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

But why can't you believe them?
Too bad for you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, we fight and we fuck until we open the cuts
And now we're soberin' up but never sober enough
Allergic, allergic
Instead of holdin' me down you're only holding me up
It shouldn't be so hard, this is impossible love
Allergic, allergic

[Pre-Chorus]
I took your pills and your drugs just to feel something else
'Cause I can't feel you no more

[Chorus]
So sad, but true
You're friends with all my demons
The only one that sees them
Too bad for you
So sad, but true
Gave a hundred million reasons
But why can't you believe them?
Too bad for you

[Outro]
So sad, but true
Gave a hundred million reasons
But why can't you believe them?
Too bad for you

Staring At The Sun (feat. SZA) by Post Malone

[Intro: Post Malone]
Oh

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Wait (Wait)
I know you gotta a lotta shit you d like to say (To say, to say)
Slow down, think you gettin' lil' carried away
You re too close, to the flame
But you don t, wanna turn around
Like you got me figured out

[Pre-Chorus 1: Post Malone]
But girl, what I can promise is I'll let you down
So don t put up a fight
You ll get lost in the light

[Chorus: Post Malone]
If you keep staring at the sun, you won t see
What you have become, this can't be
Everything you thought it was
Blinded by the thought of us, so
Give me a chance, I will
Fuck up again, I warned
You in advance
But you just keep on starin' at the sun

[Verse 2: SZA]
Wait (Yeah, yeah, wait)
I know I got a lot of shit going on with me (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
Now we're free to loving anyone other than me
I try to rewind, I get reminded that time don't wait for nobody
Can't get too close and don't let it go

[Pre-Chorus 2: SZA]
'Cause I can count on you to let me down
I won't put up a fight
I got lost in the light (Oh)

[Chorus: Post Malone and SZA]
If you keep staring at the sun, you won't see
What you have become, this can't be
Everything you thought it was
Blinded by the thought of us, so
Give me a chance, I will
Fuck up again, I warned
You in advance
But you just keep on starin' at the sun

[Bridge: Post Malone, SZA, and Both]
Wait
Got a couple little things I would like to say (Oh yeah)
Today is not your day
You should walk away (Oh yeah)
But you won't listen, you just keep on (Oh yeah)

[Chorus: Post Malone and SZA]
Staring at the sun, you won't see
What you have become, this can t be
Everything you thought it was
Blinded by the thought of us, so
Give me a chance, I will
Fuck up again, I warned
You in advance
But you just keep on starin' at the sun

Huh, huh, huh

[Chorus]
I ain't gon' say too much when a nigga speakin' on that hot shit
Fuck the police, 'cause them bitches ain't gon' stop shit
Oppositions mad, if they play they gettin' popped quick
Flyest nigga in the game, yeah, I'm a cockpit

Bullets heat a nigga up, like he eatin' on some pasta
And shoutout to Kingston, I keep me some Rastas

[Verse 1]
My niggas trappin' out the bando, shoutout to the Migos
If a nigga knock wrong, shoot him through the peephole
The trap always open, bitch, we ain't never closed
We movin' them packs and we movin' them kilos
Step one, step two, do my dance in this bitch
Got a hunnid some' drums like a band in this bitch
Mane she keep on bitchin', all that naggin' and shit
Ho shut the fuck up and jus' gag on this dick
I'm a side nigga, and I love when she swallow
If a nigga say something, hit him wit' a hollow
That glizzy, knock ya meat out ya taco
Flexin' on these bitches, they call me Johnny Bravo
School of hard knocks, let me take you to class
My bitch is real skinny but she got a lot of ass
I love counting money, I get a lot of cash
If you try to take it from me, his toe gon' have a tag

[Chorus]
I ain't gon' say too much when a nigga speakin' on that hot shit
Fuck the police, 'cause them bitches ain't gon' stop shit
Oppositions mad, if they play they gettin' popped quick
Flyest nigga in the game, yeah, I'm a cockpit
Posted on Camelot, wit' a hunnid some' shots
I be swimmin' wit' the sharks, lil' nigga you a lobster
Bullets heat a nigga up, like he eatin' on some pasta
And shoutout to Kingston, I keep me some Rastas

[Verse 2]
All up in the party, you know we keep them carbons
Bring a nigga chills like I work at Baskin-Robbins
I love Batman, but a young nigga robbin'
Firework show, 'cause my niggas get to sparklin'
I'm a hot head, I'll crash any second
He speakin' on who? Send his bitch ass to heaven
Extended clips, when we tote them MAC-11's
My niggas they be crippin', they be screamin' out them 7's
Why you investigating me? 'Cause I don't know a thing
And I'ma always keep a solid, I ain't never sang
You know I'm Shotta Fam, always gotta rep the gang
He kept on dissin' so a nigga had to snatch his brain

[Outro]
Had to snatch his brain (Had to snatch that nigga brain)
I had to snatch his brain (Had to snatch that nigga brain)
I had to make it rain (Make that mothafucka' rain)
R. Kelly, let that fuckin' choppa sing, yeah (Make it sing)

Panini - DaBaby Remix by Lil Nas X

[Intro: Nessly]
D-D-Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)

[Verse 1: Lil Nas X]
Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny? I
It's a dream, he wished it on a genie
I got fans finally, ain't you wantin' them to see me? I

[Refrain: Lil Nas X]
I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied

[Chorus: Lil Nas X & DaBaby]
Just say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me
Baby, let's go, uh

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
Okay, this song right here remind me of my ex
Say I be declinin' all her calls and I don't respond to none of her texts
I be like, "Girl, hush your mouth, you know I ain't got time for nothin' but sex"
She know I injured my right hand so when I get behind I use my left
She watched that "Walker Texas Ranger," say I remind her of Nas X
I'm talkin' "Old Town Road," all my hoes down low
They like girls and I like girls, three at a time, sometimes four
And if my backend not all hundreds and ain't on time, then I don't go
I be like...

[Chorus: Lil Nas X & DaBaby]
Say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me
What you want?

[Verse 3: Lil Nas X]
Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny now?
Now they need me, number one on streaming
Oh yeah, you used to love me
So what happened, what's the meaning? I

[Refrain: Lil Nas X]
I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied

[Bridge: Lil Nas X]
Now when it's all done, I get the upper hand
I need a big Benz, not another fan
But I still want you as a fan
I'ma need to sit down, don't mean to make demands
But I need you to...

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
Say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me

Don't care about your puppy, just that ass and them breastses
Oh girl, you a model? Damn, I never woulda guessed it
And if you tryna throw out all them vibes, I'ma catch 'em
The lifestyle we live is just too dangerous
Paranoid since they've been leakin' my shit
Wonder if it'll come out on the web

Takin' a photo and postin' that shit
Comin' home late and I crawl into bed
She always be askin' me, "Where have you been?"
Whoa

Well, if ignorance is bliss, then don't wake me up
And I'll prolly be the last to know (Whoa)
